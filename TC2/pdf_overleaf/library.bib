abstract = {Small-conductance calcium-activated potassium (SK) channels mediate medium after-hyperpolarization (AHP) conductances in neurons throughout the central nervous system. However, the expression profile and subcellular localization of different SK channel isoforms in lumbar spinal $\alpha$-motoneurons ($\alpha$-MNs) is unknown. Using immunohistochemical labelling of rat, mouse and cat spinal cord, we reveal a differential and overlapping expression of SK2 and SK3 isoforms across specific types of $\alpha$-MNs. In rodents, SK2 is expressed in all $\alpha$-MNs, whereas SK3 is expressed preferentially in small-diameter $\alpha$-MNs; in cats, SK3 is expressed in all $\alpha$-MNs. Function-specific expression of SK3 was explored using post hoc immunostaining of electrophysiologically characterized rat $\alpha$-MNs in vivo. These studies revealed strong relationships between SK3 expression and medium AHP properties. Motoneurons with SK3-immunoreactivity exhibit significantly longer AHP half-decay times (24.67 vs. 11.02 ms) and greater AHP amplitudes (3.27 vs. 1.56 mV) than MNs lacking SK3-immunoreactivity. We conclude that the differential expression of SK isoforms in rat and mouse spinal cord may contribute to the range of medium AHP durations across specific MN functional types and may be a molecular factor distinguishing between slow- and fast-type $\alpha$-MNs in rodents. Furthermore, our results show that SK2- and SK3-immunoreactivity is enriched in distinct postsynaptic domains that contain Kv2.1 channel clusters associated with cholinergic C-boutons on the soma and proximal dendrites of $\alpha$-MNs. We suggest that this remarkably specific subcellular membrane localization of SK channels is likely to represent the basis for a cholinergic mechanism for effective regulation of channel function and cell excitability.},

abstract = {Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are believed to represent the different outcomes of a common pathogenic mechanism. However, while researchers have intensely studied the involvement of motor neurons in the ALS/FTD syndrome, very little is known about the function of hippocampal neurons, although this area is critical for memory and other cognitive functions. We investigated the electrophysiological properties of CA1 pyramidal cells in slices from 1 month-old UBQLN2P497H mice, a recently generated model of ALS/FTD that shows heavy depositions of ubiquilin2-positive aggregates in this brain region. We found that, compared to wild-type mice, cells from UBQLN2P497H mice were hypo-excitable. The amplitude of the glutamatergic currents elicited by afferent fiber stimulation was reduced by {\~{}}50{\%}, but no change was detected in paired-pulse plasticity. The maximum firing frequency in response to depolarizing current injection was reduced by {\~{}}30{\%}; the fast and afterhyperpolarization in response to a range of depolarizations was reduced by almost 10 mV; the maximum slow afterhyperpolarization was also significantly decreased, likely in consequence of the decreased number of spikes. Finally, the action potential upstroke was blunted and the threshold depolarized compared to controls. Thus, synaptic and intrinsic excitability are both impaired in CA1 pyramidal cells of UBQLN2P497H mice, likely constituting a cellular mechanism for the cognitive impairments. Because these alterations are detectable before the establishment of overt pathology, we hypothesize that they may affect the further course of the disease.},

abstract = {The modulation of Kv1.4 K+ channels by the neuroprotective agent riluzole was studied in bovine adrenal zona fasciculata cells by using whole-cell patch clamp. At concentrations ranging from 1 to 100 microM, riluzole reversibly inhibited Kv1.4 channels (IC50 = 70 microM) and irreversibly slowed Kv1.4 inactivation. Riluzole (100 microM) increased the inactivation time constant (tau(i)) from a control value of 28.9 +/- 3.9 to 623 +/- 47.6 ms (n = 13). The slowing of bKv1.4 inactivation was not affected by substituting poorly hydrolyzable nucleotides for ATP in the pipette solution, or by the addition of cAMP. Riluzole-induced slowing of bKv1.4 inactivation was nearly eliminated by the presence of the antioxidant reduced glutathione (3 mM) or dithiothreitol (3-5 mM) in the recording pipette, or when cells were superfused with riluzole at a holding potential of -40 mV rather than -80 mV. These results are consistent with a model in which riluzole inhibits bKv1.4 currents and slows inactivation by separate mechanisms. Slowing of inactivation is independent of protein kinases, but probably involves oxidation of a cysteine in the N-terminal inactivation domain. Failure of riluzole to slow inactivation when applied to a depolarized cell suggests that this cysteine is protected in an inactivated Kv1.4 channel. The neuroprotective action of riluzole involves inhibition of glutamate release from presynaptic terminals within the central nervous system. Kv1.4 K+ channels are distributed throughout the brain in axons and nerve terminals, including those from which glutamate is released. The pronounced slowing of Kv1.4 inactivation by riluzole in these neurons could be an important mechanism underlying the inhibition of glutamate release and the therapeutic actions of this drug.},

abstract = {The purpose of the study was to determine the effect of motor-unit synchronization on the surface electromyogram (EMG) and isometric force using a computer model of muscle contraction. The EMG and force were simulated by generating muscle fiber action potentials, defining motor-unit mechanical characteristics and territories, estimating motor-unit action potentials, specifying motor-unit discharge times, and imposing various levels of motor-unit synchronization. The output (EMG and force) was simulated at 11 levels of excitation, ranging from 5 to 100{\%} of maximum. To synchronize motor-unit activity, selected motor-unit discharge times were adjusted; however, the number of motor units recruited and the average discharge rate of each unit was constant across synchronization conditions for a given level of excitation. Two levels of synchronization were imposed on the discharge times: a moderate and a high level, which approximated the experimentally observed range of motor-unit synchronization. The moderate level of synchrony caused the average EMG to increase by approximately 65{\%}, whereas the high level caused a 130{\%} increase in the EMG with respect to the no-synchrony condition. Neither synchrony condition influenced the magnitude of the average force. However, motor-unit synchronization did increase the amplitude of the fluctuations in the simulated force, especially at intermediate levels of excitation. In conclusion, motor-unit synchronization increased the amplitude of the average rectified EMG and decreased the steadiness of the force exerted by the muscle in simulated contractions.},

abstract = {The goal of this study was to improve the ability of a motor unit model to predict experimentally measured force variability across a wide range of forces. Motor unit discharge characteristics were obtained from 38 motor units of the first dorsal interosseus muscle. Motor unit discharges were recorded in separate isometric contractions that ranged from 4 to 85{\%} of the maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) force above recruitment threshold. High-threshold motor units exhibited both greater minimal and peak discharge rates compared with low-threshold units (P {\textless} 0.01). Minimal discharge rate increased from 7 to 23 pps, and peak discharge rate increased from 14 to 38 pps with an increase in recruitment threshold. Relative discharge rate variability (CV) decreased exponentially for each motor unit from an average of 30 to 13{\%} as index finger force increased above recruitment threshold. In separate experiments, force variability was assessed at eight force levels from 2 to 95{\%} MVC. The CV for force decreased from 4.9 to 1.4{\%} as force increased from 2 to 15{\%} MVC (P {\textless} 0.01) and remained constant at higher forces (1.2-1.9{\%}; P = 0.14). When the motor unit model was revised using these experimental findings, discharge rate variability was the critical factor that resulted in no significant difference between simulated and experimental force variability (P = 0.22) at all force levels. These results support the hypothesis that discharge rate variability is a major determinant of the trends in isometric force variability across the working range of a muscle.},

abstract = {The force exerted by a muscle during a voluntary contraction depends on the number of motor units recruited for the action and the rates at which they discharge action potentials (rate coding). Over most of the operating range of a muscle, the nervous system controls muscle force by varying both motor unit recruitment and rate coding. Except at relatively low forces, however, the control of muscle force depends primarily on rate coding, especially during fast contractions. This review provides five examples of how the modulation of rate coding influences the force exerted by muscle during voluntary actions. The five examples comprise fast contractions, lengthening and shortening contractions, steady isometric contractions, fatiguing contractions, and contractions performed after a change in the daily level of physical activity.},

abstract = {Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive loss of motoneurons. Hyperexcitability and excitotoxicity have been implicated in the early pathogenesis of ALS. Studies addressing excitotoxic motoneuron death and intracellular Ca2+ overload have mostly focused on Ca2+ influx through AMPA glutamate receptors. However, intrinsic excitability of motoneurons through voltage-gated ion channels may also have a role in the neurodegeneration. In this study we examined the function and localization of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels in cultured spinal cord motoneurons from mice expressing a mutant form of human superoxide dismutase-1 with a Gly93 → Ala substitution (G93A-SOD1). Using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings, we showed that high voltage activated (HVA) Ca2+ currents are increased in G93A-SOD1 motoneurons, but low voltage activated Ca2+ currents are not affected. G93A-SOD1 motoneurons also have altered persistent Ca2+ current mediated by L-type Ca2+ channels. Quantitative single-cell RT-PCR revealed higher levels of Ca1a, Ca1b, Ca1c, and Ca1e subunit mRNA expression in G93A-SOD1 motoneurons, indicating that the increase of HVA Ca2+ currents may result from upregulation of Ca2+ channel mRNA expression in motoneurons. The localizations of the Ca1B N-type and Ca1D L-type Ca2+ channels in motoneurons were examined by immunocytochemistry and confocal microscopy. G93A-SOD1 motoneurons had increased Ca1B channels on the plasma membrane of soma and dendrites. Ca1D channels are similar on the plasma membrane of soma and lower on the plasma membrane of dendrites of G93A-SOD1 motoneurons. Our study demonstrates that voltage-gated Ca2+ channels have aberrant functions and localizations in ALS mouse motoneurons. The increased HVA Ca2+ currents and PCCa current could contribute to early pathogenesis of ALS.},

abstract = {1. The relationship between the motor unit discharge pattern (rate and variability) and synchronization of motor unit pairs was studied in the first dorsal interosseus muscle of human subjects. In separate trials of up to 4 min duration, subjects voluntarily controlled the mean discharge rate of an identified motor unit at one of several prescribed rates (range 7.5-17.5 Hz). 2. The effect of discharge rate on the synchronous peak in the cross-correlogram was examined in eighty motor unit pairs from six subjects. Five commonly used synchronization indices were used to quantify synchrony in the cross-correlograms constructed from different discharge-rate trials. For each synchronization index, the apparent magnitude of synchrony increased at lower motor unit discharge rates. The synchronization indices were not equally sensitive to discharge rate; increases in the different indices ranged from 72 to 494{\%} between the highest and lowest discharge rates. 3. A model of the membrane potential trajectory underlying rhythmic motoneuron discharge was used to explain the observed increase in the magnitude of the synchronization indices at lower discharge rates. The essential feature of this model is that the probability of a common-input EPSP causing a synchronous discharge in two motoneurons is independent of discharge rate. This means that the number of synchronous action potentials in excess of chance in any trial depends on the properties of the common-input EPSPs and the duration of the trial, but is not related to motor unit discharge rates. The model also demonstrated that when the excess synchronous counts are normalized to motor unit discharge rate, or baseline counts in the histogram (as in the conventional synchronization indices), the magnitude of the index increases when the motor unit discharge rates are low. 4. The strength of common input to motoneurons could be misinterpreted if conventional synchronization indices are used because of discharge-rate effects. The model was used to derive an index of the strength of common input to motoneurons (CIS) that was independent of motor unit discharge rate. CIS is the frequency of synchronous action potentials in the motor unit pair in excess of those expected due to chance (calculated during periods of tonic discharge in both units). The mean CIS in first dorsal interosseus motor unit pairs ranged from 0.052 to 1.005 extra synchronous action potentials per second across subjects. 5. Discharge variability was correlated with each of the synchronization indices and the CIS.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

abstract = {Introduction: The learning of core concepts in neuroscience can be reinforced by a hands-on approach, either experimental or computer-based. In this work, we present a web-based multi-scale neuromuscular simulator that is being used as a teaching aid in a campus-wide course on the Principles of Neuroscience. Methods: The simulator has several built-in individual models based on cat and human biophysics, which are interconnected to represent part of the neuromuscular system that controls leg muscles. Examples of such elements are i) single neurons, representing either motor neurons or interneurons mediating reciprocal, recurrent and Ib inhibition; ii) afferent fibers that can be stimulated to generate spinal reflexes; iii) muscle unit models, generating force and electromyogram; and iv) stochastic inputs, representing the descending volitional motor drive. Results: Several application examples are provided in the present report, ranging from studies of individual neuron responses to the collective action of many motor units controlling muscle force generation. A subset of them was included in an optional homework assignment for Neuroscience and Biomedical Engineering graduate students enrolled in the course cited above at our University. Almost all students rated the simulator as a good or an excellent learning tool, and approximately 90{\%} declared that they would use the simulator in future projects. Conclusion: The results allow us to conclude that multi-scale neuromuscular simulator is an effective teaching tool. Special features of this free teaching resource are its direct usability from any browser (http://remoto.leb.usp.br/), its user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) and the preset demonstrations.},

abstract = {When we make saccadic eye movements or goal-directed arm movements, there is an infinite number of possible trajectories that the eye or arm could take to reach the target. However, humans show highly stereotyped trajectories in which velocity profiles of both the eye and hand are smooth and symmetric for brief movements. Here we present a unifying theory of eye and arm movements based on the single physiological assumption that the neural control signals are corrupted by noise whose variance increases with the size of the control signal. We propose that in the presence of such signal-dependent noise, the shape of a trajectory is selected to minimize the variance of the final eye or arm position. This minimum-variance theory accurately predicts the trajectories of both saccades and arm movements and the speed-accuracy trade-off described by Fitt's law. These profiles are robust to changes in the dynamics of the eye or arm, as found empirically. Moreover, the relation between path curvature and hand velocity during drawing movements reproduces the empirical 'two-thirds power law. This theory provides a simple and powerful unifying perspective for both eye and arm movement control.},

abstract = {Studies have reported the benefits of sensory noise in motor performance, but it is not clear if this phenomenon is influenced by muscle contraction intensity. Additionally, most of the studies investigated the role of a stochastic noise on the improvement of motor control and there is no evidence that a sinusoidal vibrotactile stimulation could also enhance motor performance. Eleven participants performed a sensorimotor task while sinusoidal vibrations were applied to the finger skin. The effects of an optimal vibration (OV) on force steadiness were evaluated in different contraction intensities. We assessed the standard deviation (SD) and coefficient of variation (CoV) of force signals. OV significantly decreased force SD irrespective of contraction intensity, but the decrease in force CoV was significantly higher for low-intensity contraction. To the best of our knowledge, our findings are the first evidence that sinusoidal vibrotactile stimulation can enhance force steadiness in a motor task. Also, the significant improvement caused by OV during low-intensity contractions is probably due to the higher sensitivity of the motor system to the synaptic noise. These results add to the current knowledge on the effects of vibrotactile stimulation in motor control and have potential implications for the development of wearable haptic devices.},

abstract = {1. Isometric muscle force and the surface electromyogram (EMG) were simulated from a model that predicted recruitment and firing times in a pool of 120 motor units under different levels of excitatory drive. The EMG-force relationships that emerged from simulations using various schedules of recruitment and rate coding were compared with those observed experimentally to determine which of the modeled schemes were plausible representations of the actual organization in motor-unit pools. 2. The model was comprised of three elements: a motoneuron model, a motor-unit force model, and a model of the surface EMG. Input to the neuron model was an excitatory drive function representing the net synaptic input to motoneurons during voluntary muscle contractions. Recruitment thresholds were assigned such that many motoneurons had low thresholds and relatively few neurons had high thresholds. Motoneuron firing rate increased as a linear function of excitatory drive between recruitment threshold and peak firing rate levels. The sequence of discharge times for each motoneuron was simulated as a random renewal process. 3. Motor-unit twitch force was estimated as an impulse response of a critically damped, second-order system. Twitch amplitudes were assigned according to rank in the recruitment order, and twitch contraction times were inversely related to twitch amplitude. Nonlinear force-firing rate behavior was simulated by varying motor-unit force gain as a function of the instantaneous firing rate and the contraction time of the unit. The total force exerted by the muscle was computed as the sum of the motor-unit forces. 4. Motor-unit action potentials were simulated on the basis of estimates of the number and location of motor-unit muscle fibers and the propagation velocity of the fiber action potentials. The number of fibers innervated by each unit was assumed to be directly proportional to the twitch force. The area of muscle encompassing unit fibers was proportional to the number of fibers innervated, and the location of motor-unit territories were randomly assigned within the muscle cross section. Action-potential propagation velocities were estimated from an inverse function of contraction time. The train of discharge times predicted from the motoneuron model determined the occurrence of each motor-unit action potential. The surface EMG was synthesized as the sum of all motor-unit action-potential trains. 5. Two recruitment conditions were tested: narrow (limit of recruitment {\textless} 50{\%} maximum excitation) and broad recruitment range conditions (limit of recruitment {\textgreater} 70{\%} maximum excitation).},

The twitches were elicited by stimuli in the endplate zone, the force of the smallest twitches corresponding to the average of one or two motor units. The time to peak contraction was measured of 20201330 bundles of fibres in each muscle examined. The histograms of contraction times agreed with histochemical findings; contraction times longer than 60 msec corresponded to the proportion of fibres rich in mitochondria. Thus, long contraction times predominated in the soleus and gastrocnemius muscles, comprised half the times in the anterior tibia], a third in the brachial biceps (long head) and a few per cent in the brachial triceps muscle (lateral head). Bundles of fibres with short contraction times, those poor in mitochondria had a higher temperature coefficient of the time to peak than bundles with long contraction times. During hypoxia the contraction times shortened. The contraction time of motor units first activated voluntarily lay near the mean of bundles activated electrically. The contraction times of fasciculating fibres were in the range of electrically evoked twitches; the force was about three times that of voluntarily activated units.},

There seems to be a wide spread view that we need to do something to address this problem, as it is essential to the advancement of our field. The most compelling argument would seem to be that reproducibility of experimental results is the hallmark of science. Therefore, given that most of us regard machine learning as a scientific discipline, being able to replicate experiments is paramount. I want to challenge this view by separating the notion of reproducibility, a generally desirable property, from replicability, its poor cousin. I claim there are important differences between the two. Reproducibility requires changes; replicability avoids them. Although reproducibility is desirable, I contend that the impoverished version, replicability, is one not worth having.},

abstract = {Computational models of motor-unit populations are the objective implementations of the hypothesized mechanisms by which neural and muscle properties give rise to electromyograms (EMGs) and force. However, the variability/uncertainty of the parameters used in these models--and how they affect predictions--confounds assessing these hypothesized mechanisms. We perform a large-scale computational sensitivity analysis on the state-of-the-art computational model of surface EMG, force, and force variability by combining a comprehensive review of published experimental data with Monte Carlo simulations. To exhaustively explore model performance and robustness, we ran numerous iterative simulations each using a random set of values for nine commonly measured motor neuron and muscle parameters. Parameter values were sampled across their reported experimental ranges. Convergence after 439 simulations found that only 3 simulations met our two fitness criteria: approximating the well-established experimental relations for the scaling of EMG amplitude and force variability with mean force. An additional 424 simulations preferentially sampling the neighborhood of those 3 valid simulations converged to reveal 65 additional sets of parameter values for which the model predictions approximate the experimentally known relations. We find the model is not sensitive to muscle properties but very sensitive to several motor neuron properties--especially peak discharge rates and recruitment ranges. Therefore to advance our understanding of EMG and muscle force, it is critical to evaluate the hypothesized neural mechanisms as implemented in today's state-of-the-art models of motor unit function. We discuss experimental and analytical avenues to do so as well as new features that may be added in future implementations of motor-unit models to improve their experimental validity.},

abstract = {Motoneuron (MN) dendrites may be changed from a passive to an active state by increasing the levels of spinal cord neuromodulators, which activate persistent inward currents (PICs). These exert a powerful influence on MN behavior and modify the motor control both in normal and pathological conditions. Motoneuronal PICs are believed to induce nonlinear phenomena such as the genesis of extra torque and torque hysteresis in response to percutaneous electrical stimulation or tendon vibration in humans. An existing large-scale neuromuscular simulator was expanded to include MN models that have a capability to change their dynamic behaviors depending on the neuromodulation level. The simulation results indicated that the variability (standard deviation) of a maintained force depended on the level of neuromodulatory activity. A force with lower variability was obtained when the motoneuronal network was under a strong influence of PICs, suggesting a functional role in postural and precision tasks. In an additional set of simulations when PICs were active in the dendrites of the MN models, the results successfully reproduced experimental results reported from humans. Extra torque was evoked by the self-sustained discharge of spinal MNs, whereas differences in recruitment and de-recruitment levels of the MNs were the main reason behind torque and electromyogram (EMG) hysteresis. Finally, simulations were also used to study the influence of inhibitory inputs on a MN pool that was under the effect of PICs. The results showed that inhibition was of great importance in the production of a phasic force, requiring a reduced co-contraction of agonist and antagonist muscles. These results show the richness of functionally relevant behaviors that can arise from a MN pool under the action of PICs.},

abstract = {Expert musicians show experience-dependent reduced asymmetry in the structure of motor-related brain areas and in the maximum tapping frequency between the hands. Therefore we hypothesized that a reduced hand-skill asymmetry is strongly related to rapid and rhythmical bimanual coordination and developed a dynamical model including a symmetry-breaking parameter $\Delta$$\omega$, for human bimanual coordination. We conducted unimanual and bimanual drumming experiments to test the following model predictions. 1) The asymmetry in the maximum tapping frequency is more pronounced in nondrummers than that in drummers. If so, 2) a larger number of phase wanderings (i.e., succession of taps by the same hand), 3) larger SD of the relative phase between the hands (SD ), and 4) larger deviation of mean relative phase (mean ) from 180° would be observed in nondrummers than that in professional drummers during antiphase bimanual drumming at the maximum speed. In a unimanual tapping task, the asymmetry in maximum tapping frequency of nondrummers was more pronounced than that of professional drummers. In a bimanual coordination task, phase wanderings were observed only in nondrummers and SD of the nondrummers is significantly larger than that of professional drummers. On the other hand, there was no significant difference between the mean of the two groups. All these observations were successfully reproduced by changing $\Delta$$\omega$, which corresponded to the asymmetry in the maximum tapping frequency. These results support the hypothesis indicating that the prominent bimanual coordination pattern emerges spontaneously after a nonspecific change in $\Delta$$\omega$ or symmetry restoration of the nonlinear dynamical systems.},

abstract = {The purpose of the study was to quantify the effect of motor-unit synchronization on the spike-triggered average forces of a population of motor units. Muscle force was simulated by defining mechanical and activation characteristics of the motor units, specifying motor neuron discharge times, and imposing various levels of motor-unit synchronization. The model comprised 120 motor units. Simulations were performed for motor units 5-120 to compare the spike-triggered average responses in the presence and absence of motor-unit synchronization with the motor-unit twitch characteristics defined in the model. To synchronize motor-unit activity, selected motor-unit discharge times were adjusted; this kept the number of action potentials constant across the three levels of synchrony for each motor unit. Because there was some overlap of motor-unit twitches even at minimal discharge rates, the simulations indicated that spike-triggered averaging underestimates the twitch force of all motor units and the contraction time of motor units with contraction times longer than 49 ms. Although motor-unit synchronization increased the estimated twitch force and decreased the estimated contraction time of all motor units, spike-triggered average force changed systematically with the level of synchrony in motor units 59-120 (upper 90{\%} of the range of twitch forces). However, the reduction in contraction time was similar for moderate and high synchrony. In conclusion, spike-triggered averaging appears to provide a biased estimate of the distribution of twitch properties for a population of motor units because twitch fusion causes an underestimation of twitch force for slow units and motor-unit synchronization causes an overestimation of force for fast motor units.},

abstract = {Oscillations in the primary motor cortex are transmitted through the corticospinal tract to the motoneuron pool. This pathway is believed to produce an effective and direct command from the motor cortex to the spinal motoneurons for the modulation of the force output. In this study, we used a computational model of a population of motoneurons to investigate the factors that can influence the transmission of the cortical input to the output of motoneurons, since it can be quantified by coherence analysis. The simulations demonstrated that, despite the nonlinearity of the motoneurons, oscillations present in the cortical input are transmitted to the output of the motoneuron pool at the same frequency. However, the interference introduced by the nonlinearity of the system increases the variability of the oscillations in output, introducing spectral lines whose frequency depends on the input frequencies and the motoneuron discharge rates. Moreover, an additional source of synaptic input common to all motoneurons but independent from the corticospinal component decorrelates the cortical input and motoneuron output and, thus, decreases the magnitude of the estimated coherence, even if the effective cortical drive does not change. These results indicate that the corticospinal input can effectively be sampled by a small population of motoneurons. However, the transmission of a corticospinal drive to the motoneuron pool is influenced by the nonlinearity of the spiking processes of the active motoneurons and by synaptic inputs common to the motoneuron population but independent from the cortical input.},

abstract = {Persistent inward currents (PICs) are present in many types of neurons and likely have diverse functions. In spinal motoneurons, PICs are especially strong, primarily located in dendritic regions, and subject to particularly strong neuromodulation by the monoamines serotonin and norepinephrine. Because motoneurons drive muscle fibers, it has been possible to study the functional role of their PICs in motor output and to identify PIC-mediated effects on motoneuron firing patterns in human subjects. The PIC markedly amplifies synaptic input, up to fivefold or more, depending on the level of monoaminergic input. PICs also tend to greatly prolong input time course, allowing brief inputs to initiate long-lasting self-sustained firing (i.e., bistable behavior). PIC deactivation usually requires inhibitory input and PIC amplitude can increase to repeated activation. All of these behaviors markedly increase motoneuron excitability. Thus, in the absence of monoaminergic input, motoneuron excitability is very low. Yet PICs have another effect: once active, they tend to sharply limit efficacy of additional synaptic input. All of these PIC effects have been detected in motoneuron firing patterns in human subjects and, hence, PICs are likely a fundamental component of normal motor output.},

The M1 response originates from the monosynaptic Ia afferent reflex pathway. The M2 response is less well understood and is likely a compound response to different afferent inputs mediated by spinal and transcortical pathways. In this study the possible contribution of the Ia afferent pathway to the M2 response was investigated. A mechanism was hypothesized in which the M1 response synchronizes the motoneurons, and therewith their refractory periods. Stretch perturbation experiments were performed on the wrist and results were compared with a computational model of a pool of motoneurons receiving tonic and Ia afferent input. The simulations showed the same stretch amplitude, velocity, and duration-dependent characteristics on the M2 as found experimentally. It was concluded that the stretch duration effect of the M2 likely originates from the proposed Ia afferent mediated mechanism.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Presynaptic inhibition (PSI) has been shown to modulate several neuronal pathways of functional relevance by selectively gating the connections between sensory inputs and spinal motoneurons, thereby regulating the contribution of the stretch reflex circuitry to the ongoing motor activity. In this study, we investigated whether a differential regulation of Ia afferent inflow by PSI may be associated with the performance of two types of plantarflexion sensoriomotor tasks. The subjects (in a seated position) controlled either: 1) the force level exerted by the foot against a rigid restraint (force task, FT); or 2) the angular position of the ankle when sustaining inertial loads (position task, PT) that required the same level of muscle activation observed in FT. Subjects were instructed to maintain their force/position at target levels set at {\~{}}10{\%} of maximum isometric voluntary contraction for FT and 90° for PT, while visual feedback of the corresponding force/position signals were provided. Unconditioned H-reflexes (i.e. control reflexes) and H-reflexes conditioned by electrical pulses applied to the common peroneal nerve with conditioning-to-test intervals of 21 ms and 100 ms (corresponding to D1 and D2 inhibitions, respectively) were evoked in a random fashion. A significant main effect for the type of the motor task (FT {\textless}italic{\textgreater}vs{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} PT) (p = 0.005, $\eta${\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}p{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} = 0.603) indicated that PTs were undertaken with lower levels of Ia PSI converging onto the soleus motoneuron pool. Additionally, a significant interaction between the type of inhibition (D1 {\textless}italic{\textgreater}vs{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} D2) and the type of motor task (FT {\textless}italic{\textgreater}vs{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} PT) (p = 0.038, $\eta${\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}p{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} = 0.395) indicated that D1 inhibition was associated with a significant reduction in PSI levels from TF to TP (p = 0.001, $\eta${\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}p{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} = 0.731), whereas no significant difference between the tasks was observed for D2 inhibition (p = 0.078, $\eta${\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}p{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} = 0.305). These results suggest that D1 and D2 inhibitions of the soleus H-reflex are differentially modulated during the performance of plantarflexion FT and PT. The reduced level of ongoing PSI during PT suggests that, in comparison to FT, there is a larger reliance on inputs from muscle spindles primary afferents when the neuromuscular system is required to maintain position-controlled plantarflexion contractions.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {The input-output properties of motoneurons (MNs) and motor units (MUs) may be modulated by different physiological variables, including neuromodulators released by presynaptic neurons from the brainstem. Monoamines, such as serotonin and norepinephrine, act on MNs mainly by activating dendritic L-type Ca ++ channels, generating a persistent inward current (PIC), which may change the input-output properties of the MU. If the firing properties of individual MNs and also the features of the force generated by the MUs can be changed, it follows that the descending monoaminergic systems may modulate the overall dynamics of motor control. The purpose of the present study is to investigate the effects of neuromodulation on the input-output properties of mathematically modeled type-specified MUs. Computationally efficient models are presented for S- and F-type mammalian MNs as well as a MN pool commanding muscle units of the Soleus muscle. The single models have a dendritic L-type Ca ++ channel, generating a PIC, along with somatic currents that are responsible for spike-generating mechanisms and the afterhyperpolarization. The S-type active-dendrite (AD) MN model resulted highly excitable and discharged in a self-sustained manner after an excitatory input (bistability). An inhibitory activity turned off this self-sustained discharge. In addition, this low-threshold MN model showed a significant reduction in interspike interval (ISI) variability in comparison with an equivalent passive-dendrite (PD) MN model discharging at a similar mean rate. The frequency response gain from presynaptic spike train rate modulation to output spike train modulation had a clear valley from about 1-10Hz for the S-type AD MN model, whereas the PD model showed a gain increase instead. On the other hand, the frequency responses of PD and AD F-type models were similarly shaped, with the AD model having a higher gain at high frequencies. These results suggest that in motor behaviors where steady or low frequency activity is required, such as posture, PICs would aid low-threshold MNs to respond with regular spikes, reducing output variability, and would attenuate the effects of high-frequency input disturbances, helping maintain system steadiness. At the same time, high-threshold MNs being more responsive to high-frequency disturbances would contribute with the necessary activity to correct for postural deviations from a desired position. Simulation results from the neuromuscular model have shown that the PIC activation profoundly affects muscle force generation, with the neuromodulatory activity acting in the adjustment of the motor output. Both individual and collective results presented here expand the understanding of the versatility of monoaminergic neuromodulation in adjusting both the MN input-output coding and the control of force generation. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {1. Isometric muscle force and the surface electromyogram (EMG) were simulated from a model that predicted recruitment and firing times in a pool of 120 motor units under different levels of excitatory drive. The EMG-force relationships that emerged from simulations using various schedules of recruitment and rate coding were compared with those observed experimentally to determine which of the modeled schemes were plausible representations of the actual organization in motor-unit pools. 2. The model was comprised of three elements: a motoneuron model, a motor-unit force model, and a model of the surface EMG. Input to the neuron model was an excitatory drive function representing the net synaptic input to motoneurons during voluntary muscle contractions. Recruitment thresholds were assigned such that many motoneurons had low thresholds and relatively few neurons had high thresholds. Motoneuron firing rate increased as a linear function of excitatory drive between recruitment threshold and peak firing rate levels. The sequence of discharge times for each motoneuron was simulated as a random renewal process. 3. Motor-unit twitch force was estimated as an impulse response of a critically damped, second-order system. Twitch amplitudes were assigned according to rank in the recruitment order, and twitch contraction times were inversely related to twitch amplitude. Nonlinear force-firing rate behavior was simulated by varying motor-unit force gain as a function of the instantaneous firing rate and the contraction time of the unit. The total force exerted by the muscle was computed as the sum of the motor-unit forces. 4. Motor-unit action potentials were simulated on the basis of estimates of the number and location of motor-unit muscle fibers and the propagation velocity of the fiber action potentials. The number of fibers innervated by each unit was assumed to be directly proportional to the twitch force. The area of muscle encompassing unit fibers was proportional to the number of fibers innervated, and the location of motor-unit territories were randomly assigned within the muscle cross section. Action-potential propagation velocities were estimated from an inverse function of contraction time. The train of discharge times predicted from the motoneuron model determined the occurrence of each motor-unit action potential. The surface EMG was synthesized as the sum of all motor-unit action-potential trains. 5. Two recruitment conditions were tested: narrow (limit of recruitment {\textless} 50{\%} maximum excitation) and broad recruitment range conditions (limit of recruitment {\textgreater} 70{\%} maximum excitation).},

abstract = {The applicability of static optimization (and, respectively, frequently used objective functions) for prediction of individual muscle forces for dynamic conditions has often been discussed. Some of the problems are whether time-independent objective functions are suitable, and how to incorporate muscle physiology in models. The present paper deals with a twofold task: (1) implementation of hierarchical genetic algorithm (HGA) based on the properties of the motor units (MUs) twitches, and using multi-objective, time-dependent optimization functions; and (2) comparison of the results of the HGA application with those obtained through static optimization with a criterion "minimum of a weighted sum of the muscle forces raised to the power of n". HGA and its software implementation are presented. The moments of neural stimulation of all MUs are design variables coding the problem in the terms of HGA. The main idea is in using genetic operations to find these moments, so that the sum of MUs twitches satisfies the imposed goals (required joint moments, minimal sum of muscle forces, etc.). Elbow flexion and extension movements with different velocities are considered as proper illustration. It is supposed that they are performed by two extensor muscles and three flexor muscles. The results show that HGA is a suitable means for precise investigation of motor control. Many experimentally observed phenomena (such as antagonistic co-contraction, three-phasic behavior of the muscles during fast movements) can find their explanation by the properties of the MUs twitches. Static optimization is also able to predict three-phasic behavior and could be used as practicable and computationally inexpensive method for total estimation of the muscle forces.},

abstract = {The purpose of the study was to determine the effect of motor-unit synchronization on the surface electromyogram (EMG) and isometric force using a computer model of muscle contraction. The EMG and force were simulated by generating muscle fiber action potentials, defining motor-unit mechanical characteristics and territories, estimating motor-unit action potentials, specifying motor-unit discharge times, and imposing various levels of motor-unit synchronization. The output (EMG and force) was simulated at 11 levels of excitation, ranging from 5 to 100{\%} of maximum. To synchronize motor-unit activity, selected motor-unit discharge times were adjusted; however, the number of motor units recruited and the average discharge rate of each unit was constant across synchronization conditions for a given level of excitation. Two levels of synchronization were imposed on the discharge times: a moderate and a high level, which approximated the experimentally observed range of motor-unit synchronization. The moderate level of synchrony caused the average EMG to increase by approximately 65{\%}, whereas the high level caused a 130{\%} increase in the EMG with respect to the no-synchrony condition. Neither synchrony condition influenced the magnitude of the average force. However, motor-unit synchronization did increase the amplitude of the fluctuations in the simulated force, especially at intermediate levels of excitation. In conclusion, motor-unit synchronization increased the amplitude of the average rectified EMG and decreased the steadiness of the force exerted by the muscle in simulated contractions.},

We discuss the basic layout of such simulations, including the methods of simulation setup, the run-time spike-passing paradigm, and postsimulation data storage and data management approaches. Using the Neuroscience Gateway, a portal for computational neuroscience that provides access to large HPCs, we benchmark simulations of neuronal networks of different sizes (500?100,000 cells), and using different numbers of nodes (1?256). We compare three types of networks, composed of either Izhikevich integrate-and-fire neurons (I{\&}F), single-compartment Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) cells, or a hybrid network with half of each. Results show simulation run time increased approximately linearly with network size and decreased almost linearly with the number of nodes.

The elec- tromyographic (EMG) signals were decomposed into the individual motor-unit action potential trains comprising the signal. The interac- tion among motor units were characterized by the estimated time- varying mean firing rate and the cross-correlation between the time- varying mean firing rates of pairs of motor units. Pairs of motor units within each muscle as well as pairs of motor units across the muscles were considered. In-phase common fluctuations, termed common drive, were observed in the mean firing rates of motor units within each muscle, consistent with earlier work on other muscles. Common fluctuations were also observed between the firing rates of ECU and ECRL motor units albeit with a variable phase shift. The existence of common drive across synergistic muscles was interpreted as implying that the CNS considers the muscles as a functional unit when they act as synergists.},

abstract = {1. The rhythmic firing properties of cat lumbar motoneurons were determined by intracellular injection of constant-current pulses. The activation thresholds of various membrane current components were subsequently determined in the same neurons using the technique of somatic voltage clamp. Voltage steps were employed that traversed the same voltage range as the membrane potential between rhythmic spikes (the "pacemaker potential"). 2. At fast firing rates (e.g., secondary-range firing), the pacemaker potential remains entirely within the range of voltages over which a previously described (42), persistent, inward, calcium current (Ii) is activated during voltage clamp. Thus Ii is tonically activated and counters the repolarizing, outward, potassium currents during fast firing. At slower firing rates (e.g., primary-range firing), the pacemaker potential only partially enters the voltage range where Ii is activated, and this voltage range may not be entered at all the slowest firing rates. Cells in which Ii deteriorated could not be made to fire at fast rates although they could still fire at slow rates. 3. The use of two independent intracellular microelectrodes allowed accurate measurement of the somatic voltage at which spike initiation occurred ("firing level"). In all cells, firing level increased significantly as steady firing rate increased. During a given injected-current pulse, firing level also exhibited a more moderate variation with time. 4. The variation in firing level was caused by the accommodative properties of the axon initial segment. Except at the fastest firing rates, firing level occurs at less depolarized voltages than the somatic sodium conductance threshold. In addition, somatic sodium current shows minimal inactivation over the voltage range traversed by the pacemaker potentials during slower firing rates. An inactivation of about 50{\%} is attained during the maximum firing rate. 5. We discuss the ways by which Ii activation and thr progressive rise in firing level influence motoneuron rhythmic firing. We propose that the basic role of Ii is to aid in maintaining a linear f-I curve, especially at faster firing rates. We hypothesize that the relative balance between persistent inward and outward ionic currents plays a major role in determining the f-I curve slope among different neurons and between primary- and secondary-range firing of cat lumbar motoneurons.},

abstract = {Excitatory post-synaptic potentials (e.p.s.p.s) were evoked in spinal motoneurones (of anaesthetized cats) by impulses in single group Ia axons. The morphological details of the Ia axon-motoneurone connexion involved in generating each e.p.s.p. were subsequently reconstructed, as described by Redman {\&} Walmsley (1983). The fluctuation pattern of the peak amplitude of each e.p.s.p. was determined using a deconvolution method, taking into account the recording noise. Four e.p.s.p.s were analysed. One did not fluctuate in amplitude; the others fluctuated between discrete amplitudes which were separated by quantal increments. The number of increments which must be added to produce the largest peak amplitude of each e.p.s.p. was always less than, or equal to, the number of synaptic boutons in the connexion at which the e.p.s.p. was generated. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that transmission occurs in an all-or-none manner at each synaptic bouton. Different boutons in the termination of a Ia axon with a motoneurone have different probabilities of releasing transmitter, and this probability is sometimes zero at low stimulation rates. The results support the idea that the discrete amplitudes of an evoked e.p.s.p. result from intermittent transmission, in an all-or-none manner, at some or all of the boutons in the termination.},

abstract = {We tested the hypothesis that the nervous system, and the cortex in particular, is a critical determinant of muscle strength/weakness and that a high level of corticospinal inhibition is an important neurophysiological factor regulating force generation. A group of healthy individuals underwent 4 wk of wrist-hand immobilization to induce weakness. Another group also underwent 4 wk of immobilization, but they also performed mental imagery of strong muscle contractions 5 days/wk. Mental imagery has been shown to activate several cortical areas that are involved with actual motor behaviors, including premotor and M1 regions. A control group, who underwent no interventions, also participated in this study. Before, immediately after, and 1 wk following immobilization, we measured wrist flexor strength, voluntary activation (VA), and the cortical silent period (SP; a measure that reflect corticospinal inhibition quantified via transcranial magnetic stimulation). Immobilization decreased strength 45.1 ± 5.0{\%}, impaired VA 23.2 ± 5.8{\%}, and prolonged the SP 13.5 ± 2.6{\%}. Mental imagery training, however, attenuated the loss of strength and VA by ∼50{\%} (23.8 ± 5.6{\%} and 12.9 ± 3.2{\%} reductions, respectively) and eliminated prolongation of the SP (4.8 ± 2.8{\%} reduction). Significant associations were observed between the changes in muscle strength and VA (r = 0.56) and SP (r = -0.39). These findings suggest neurological mechanisms, most likely at the cortical level, contribute significantly to disuse-induced weakness, and that regular activation of the cortical regions via imagery attenuates weakness and VA by maintaining normal levels of inhibition.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The relationship between surface electromyography (EMG) and muscle force is essential to assess muscle function and its deficits. However, few studies have explored the EMG-force relation in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The purpose of this study was to examine the EMG-force relation in ALS subjects and its alteration in comparison with healthy control subjects. METHODS: Surface EMG and force signals were recorded while 10 ALS and 10 age-matched healthy control subjects produced isometric voluntary contractions in the first dorsal interosseous (FDI) muscle over the full range of activation. A linear fit of the EMG-force relation was evaluated through the normalized root mean square error (RMSE) between the experimental and predicted EMG amplitudes. The EMG-force relation was compared between the ALS and the healthy control subjects. RESULTS: With a linear fit, the normalized RMSE between the experimental and predicted EMG amplitudes was 9.6 ± 3.6{\%} for the healthy control subjects and 12.3 ± 8.0{\%} for the ALS subjects. The slope of the linear fit was 2.9 ± 2.2 $\mu$VN(−1) for the ALS subjects and was significantly shallower (p {\textless} 0.05) than the control subjects (5.1 ± 1.8 $\mu$VN(−1)). However, after excluding the four ALS subjects who had very weak maximum force, the slope for the remaining ALS subjects was 3.5 ± 2.2 $\mu$VN(−1) and was not significantly different from the control subjects (p {\textgreater} 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: A linear fit can be used to well describe the EMG-force relation for the FDI muscle of both ALS and healthy control subjects. A variety of processes may work together in ALS that can adversely affect the EMG-force relation.},

abstract = {The purpose of the study was to expand a model of motor unit recruitment and rate coding (30) to simulate the adjustments that occur during a fatiguing contraction. The major new components of the model were the introduction of time-varying parameters for motor unit twitch force, recruitment, discharge rate, and discharge variability, and a control algorithm that estimates the net excitation needed by the motoneuron pool to maintain a prescribed target force. The fatigue-induced changes in motor unit activity in the expanded model are a function of changes in the metabolite concentrations that were computed with a compartment model of the intra- and extracellular spaces. The model was validated by comparing the simulation results with data available from the literature and experimentally recorded in the present study during isometric contractions of the first dorsal interosseus muscle. The output of the model was able to replicate a number of experimental findings, including the time to task failure for a range of target forces, the changes in motor unit discharge rates, the skewness and kurtosis of the interspike interval distributions, discharge variability, and the discharge characteristics of newly recruited motor units. The model output provides an integrative perspective of the adjustments during fatiguing contractions that are difficult to measure experimentally.},

Although recent decades have witnessed numerous discoveries that have shed light into various properties of this system, the basic principles underlying its overall operation still remain poorly understood. In this article, Carlo J. De Luca and Zeynep Erim discuss the concept of common drive of motor units that provides a possible scheme for the control of motor units, unifying various seemingly isolated findings that have been reported. According to this concept, a pool of motor units that makes up a muscle is controlled collectively during a contraction of that muscle. The unique firing patterns of individual motor units are effected, not by separate command signals sent to these units, but by one common drive to which motor units respond differently. The specific architecture of the system and the orderly gradation in the inherent properties of individual elements enable a single source to control the activities of all the motor units in a given pool. Such an arrangement relieves the CNS from the burden of monitoring and regulating each motor unit separately.},

Second, we propose an approach of convolutive sphering of the observations followed by an iterative extraction of the sources. This approach is then validated using intramuscular signals recorded by novel multi-channel thin-film electrodes on the Abductor Digiti Minimi of the hand and Tibilias Anterior muscles, as well as on high-density surface EMG signals recorded by electrode grids on the First Dorsal Interosseous muscle. The validation was based on the comparison with the gold standard of manual decomposition (for intramuscular recordings) and on the two-source method (for comparison of intramuscular and surface EMG recordings) for the three human muscles and contraction forces of up to 90{\%} MVC.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMAIN RESULTS: The average number of common sources identified for the validation was 14 ± 7 (averaged across all trials and subjects and all comparisons), with a rate of agreement in their discharge timings of 92.8 ± 3.2{\%}.

abstract = {A vertebrate motoneuron receives an enormous amount of synaptic activity from descending pathways, from spinal cord interneurons and directly from mechanoreceptor afferents. The intrinsic characteristics of the motoneuron will determine how its output spike train will encode the activities of all its inputs. Therefore, the essence of the intrinsic motoneuron characteristics should be well studied and modelled if the roles of the motoneuron as a processing or encoding element are to be well understood. Mathematical models of motoneurons have been described in the literature and tested mostly under static conditions. To increase the reality of the validation of such models, the objective of the present work is to test a few selected models described in the literature using sinusoidal injected current of different frequencies. The resulting frequency responses are compared with data available in the literature from cat type F motoneurons. Discrepancies between some of the models' responses and real motoneuron data suggest that improvements are needed in the modelling of the afterhyperpolarization mechanism.

abstract = {Motor units within human muscles usually exhibit a significant degree of short-term synchronization. Such coincident spiking typically has been attributed to last-order projections that provide common synaptic input across motor neurons. The extent of branched input arising directly from cortical neurons has often been suggested as a critical factor determining the magnitude of short-term synchrony. The purpose of this study, therefore, was to quantify motor unit synchrony in a variety of human muscles differing in the presumed extent of cortical input to their respective motor nuclei. Cross-correlation histograms were generated from the firing times of 551 pairs of motor units in 16 human muscles. Motor unit synchrony tended to be weakest for proximal muscles and strongest for more distal muscles. Previous work in monkeys and humans has shown that the strength of cortical inputs to motor neurons also exhibits a similar proximal-to-distal gradient. However, in the present study, proximal-distal location was not an exclusive predictor of synchrony magnitude. The muscle that exhibited the least synchrony was an elbow flexor, whereas the greatest synchrony was most often found in intrinsic foot muscles. Furthermore, the strength of corticospinal inputs to the abductor hallucis muscle, an intrinsic foot muscle, as assessed through transcranial magnetic stimulation, was weaker than that projecting to the tibialis anterior muscle, even though the abductor hallucis muscle had higher synchrony values compared with the tibialis anterior muscle. We argue, therefore, that factors other than the potency of cortical inputs to motor neurons, such as the number of motor neurons innervating a muscle, significantly affects motor unit synchrony.},

abstract = {Voluntary control of force is always marked by some degree of error and unsteadiness. Both neural and mechanical factors contribute to these fluctuations, but how they interact to produce them is poorly understood. In this study, we identify and characterize a previously undescribed neuromechanical interaction where the dynamics of voluntary force production suffice to generate involuntary tremor. Specifically, participants were asked to produce isometric force with the index finger and use visual feedback to track a sinusoidal target spanning 5-9{\%} of each individual's maximal voluntary force level. Force fluctuations and EMG activity over the flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS) muscle were recorded and their frequency content was analyzed as a function of target phase. Force variability in either the 1-5 or 6-15 Hz frequency ranges tended to be largest at the peaks and valleys of the target sinusoid. In those same periods, FDS EMG activity was synchronized with force fluctuations. We then constructed a physiologically-realistic computer simulation in which a muscle-tendon complex was set inside of a feedback-driven control loop. Surprisingly, the model sufficed to produce phase-dependent modulation of tremor similar to that observed in humans. Further, the gain of afferent feedback from muscle spindles was critical for appropriately amplifying and shaping this tremor. We suggest that the experimentally-induced tremor may represent the response of a viscoelastic muscle-tendon system to dynamic drive, and therefore does not fall into known categories of tremor generation, such as tremorogenic descending drive, stretch-reflex loop oscillations, motor unit behavior, or mechanical resonance. Our findings motivate future efforts to understand tremor from a perspective that considers neuromechanical coupling within the context of closed-loop control. The strategy of combining experimental recordings with physiologically-sound simulations will enable thorough exploration of neural and mechanical contributions to force control in health and disease.},

abstract = {The purpose of this review was to examine three issues that limit our understanding of motor unit physiology: (1) the range and distribution of the innervation ratios in a muscle; (2) the association between discharge rate and force; and (3) the variation in motor unit activity across contractions that differ in speed and type. We suggest that if more data were available on these issues, the understanding of neuromuscular function would be enhanced substantially, especially with regard to plasticity in the motor neuron pool, adequacy of the neural drive to muscle, and flexibility of activation patterns across various types of contractions. Current data are limited and these limitations influence our ability to interpret adaptations in muscle function in health and disease.},

abstract = {The goal of this study was to improve the ability of a motor unit model to predict experimentally measured force variability across a wide range of forces. Motor unit discharge characteristics were obtained from 38 motor units of the first dorsal interosseus muscle. Motor unit discharges were recorded in separate isometric contractions that ranged from 4 to 85{\%} of the maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) force above recruitment threshold. High-threshold motor units exhibited both greater minimal and peak discharge rates compared with low-threshold units (P {\textless} 0.01). Minimal discharge rate increased from 7 to 23 pps, and peak discharge rate increased from 14 to 38 pps with an increase in recruitment threshold. Relative discharge rate variability (CV) decreased exponentially for each motor unit from an average of 30 to 13{\%} as index finger force increased above recruitment threshold. In separate experiments, force variability was assessed at eight force levels from 2 to 95{\%} MVC. The CV for force decreased from 4.9 to 1.4{\%} as force increased from 2 to 15{\%} MVC (P {\textless} 0.01) and remained constant at higher forces (1.2-1.9{\%}; P = 0.14). When the motor unit model was revised using these experimental findings, discharge rate variability was the critical factor that resulted in no significant difference between simulated and experimental force variability (P = 0.22) at all force levels. These results support the hypothesis that discharge rate variability is a major determinant of the trends in isometric force variability across the working range of a muscle.},

abstract = {Spike shape analysis (SSA) is a method to infer motor unit (MU) activity by examining interference pattern of surface electromyography (sEMG). SSA has succeeded to assess neuromuscular adaptations after dynamic training; however, it has not been used to assess muscle activities during the dynamic movements as seen in music performance. The present study used SSA to investigate sEMG activities of wrist flexor and extensor muscles in the winner of a contest to find the world's fastest drummer (WFD) during performing rhythmic wrist flexion/extension movements with one hand using a handheld drumstick. SSA measures of the WFD were compared with those in the two control groups: non-drummers (NDs) and ordinary drummers (ODs). We found that the WFD showed significantly high mean spike frequency (MSF), short mean spike duration (MSD), and small mean number of peaks per spike (MNPPS) compared with the control groups. These results suggest that the WFD had exceptional MU activity such as higher MU discharge rate, more MU recruitment, and/or higher MU synchronization to achieve extraordinary fast 10-Hz drumming performance. SSA will be useful to investigate the muscle activity seen in music performance. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

@article{Mortimer1987,
abstract = {Electromyographic silent periods (premovement silence) preceding the initial agonist burst were studied in 11 healthy subjects who performed rapid forearm flexions and extensions. Premovement silence occurred with higher frequency during selfpaced movements when subjects produced maximum power efforts than during a reaction time paradigm. The occurrence and duration were significantly correlated with the peak acceleration of the movement. Premovement silence occurred specifically in those muscles involved in the intended movement, often in several synergists with different latencies and durations. The shortest latency of premovement silence was considerably briefer than that of the earliest voluntary increase in EMG. The findings suggest that premovement silence may increase peak muscular force by bringing motoneurons into a nonrefractory state prior to their activation. The fact that it occurred on some, but not all, trials within single subjects and had a variable duration from trial to trial suggests that it may be a learned, rather than automatic, motor response. ?? 1987.},

Ballistic actions are characterized by high firing rates, brief contraction times, and high rates of force development. A characteristic triphasic agonist/antagonist/agonist electromyographic (EMG) burst pattern occurs during ballistic movement, wherein the amount and intensity of antagonist coactivation is variable. In conditions of low-grade tonic muscular activity, a premovement EMG depression (PMD; or silent period, PMS) can occur in agonist muscles prior to ballistic contraction. The agonist PMD period may serve to potentiate the force and velocity of the following contraction. A selective activation of fast twitch motor units may occur in ballistic contractions under certain movement conditions. Finally, high-velocity ballistic training induces specific neuromuscular adaptations that occur as a function of the underlying neurophysiological mechanisms that subserve ballistic movement.},

abstract = {Force-frequency and fatigue properties of motor units in muscles that control digits of the human hand. Modulation of motor unit activation rate is a fundamental process by which the mammalian nervous system encodes muscle force. To identify how rate coding of force may change as a consequence of fatigue, intraneural microstimulation of motor axons was used to elicit twitch and force-frequency responses before and after 2 min of intermittent stimulation (40-Hz train for 330 ms, 1 train/s) in single motor units of human long finger flexor muscles and intrinsic hand muscles. Before fatigue, two groups of units could be distinguished based on the stimulus frequency needed to elicit half-maximal force; group 1 (n = 8) required 9.1 ± 0.5 Hz (means ± SD), and group 2 (n = 5) required 15.5 ± 1.1 Hz. Twitch contraction times were significantly different between these two groups (group 1 = 66. 5 ms; group 2 = 45.9 ms). Overall 18{\%} of the units were fatigue resistant [fatigue index (FI) {\textgreater} 0.75], 64{\%} had intermediate fatigue sensitivity (0.25 ≤ FI ≤ 0.75), and 18{\%} were fatigable (FI {\textless} 0.25). However, fatigability and tetanic force were not significantly different among groups. Therefore unlike findings in some other mammals, fast-contracting motor units were neither stronger nor more susceptible to fatigue than slowly contracting units. Fatigue, however, was found to be greatest in those units that initially exerted the largest forces. Despite significant slowing of contractile responses, fatigue caused the force-frequency relation to become displaced toward higher frequencies (44 ± 41{\%} increase in frequency for half-maximal force). Moreover, the greatest shift in the force-frequency relation occurred among those units exhibiting the largest force loss. A selective deficit in force at low frequencies of stimulation persisted for several minutes after the fatigue task. Overall, these findings suggest that with fatigue higher activation rates must be delivered to motor units to maintain the same relative level of force. Questions regarding classification of motor units and possible mechanisms by which fatigue-related slowing might coexist with a shift in the force-frequency curve toward higher frequencies are discussed.},

@article{Schwindt1980,
abstract = {1. Membrane currents of normal and TEA-injected cat lumbar motoneurons were investigated using the technique of somatic voltage clamp. 2. The current-voltage (I-V) relation of healthy motoneurons contains a region of negative slope conductance caused by a persistent inward current component (Ii). In the most striking examples, Ii is net inward at some potentials between 10 and 30 mV positive to resting potential. 3. Near its activation threshold (greater than or equal to 10 mV positive to rest), Ii does not decrement during prolonged voltage steps and, in most cells, activates very slowly. Ii amplitude increases and time to peak Ii decreases with further small increments of depolarization, and Ii decrements during sustained voltage steps. Maximum Ii amplitude occurs 20--30 mV positive to rest in most cells. Ii is not visible at sufficiently large depolarizations. 4. Ii appears to be mixed with potassium current components at nearly every potential where it is visible. These include a slow outward current first activated near Ii activation threshold, a fast outward current additonally activated at larger depolarizing potentials, and a fast, transient outward current that obscures the true onset of Ii at nearly every potential. 5. Ii is not carried by sodium entering via the fast, transient channels and is present after pharmacological blockage of sodium currents. It is proposed that Ii is predominantly carried by calcium ions. 6. The presence of inward tail currents after repolarization from potentials that activate a steady outward current suggest that Ii remains present but hidden at large depolarizations. Ii inactivation was further investigated in TEA-injected motoneurons since Ii and the tail currents are more prominent in these cells. 7. Conventional recordings from TEA-injected motoneurons suggest that a prolonged, postspike plateau potential is maintained by a persistent inward current. Voltage-clamp data can account for the principal features of the plateau potential. 8. Voltage-clamp results in TEA-injected motoneurons suggest that Ii is subject to little or no inactivation at potentials less than or equal to 30 mV positive to rest and to partial inactivation, at most, at higher potentials during steps lasting less than or equal to 100 ms. The apparent decay of Ii during sustained depolarization is caused by the development of a larger outward current. 9. Ii is similar in several ways to a persistent calcium current observed in some molluscan neurons. Theoretical and experimental results suggest that Ii is generated predominantly in a local region under voltage control and that the observed membrane currents govern somatic membrane potential and cell behavior.},

abstract = {Sine-wave currents intracellularly injected into spinal alpha-motoneurones were found to modulate sinusoidally the regular rhythmic firing (carrier frequency) evoked by a current step. Cycle histograms of the instantaneous frequency could be accurately fitted by sinusoidal functions. Those functions were treated as the cell output. For a given modulation frequency between 2 and 14-18 Hz, the amplitude of the cell output was linearly related to the amplitude of the sine-wave current, all over a wide range of current intensities. The sensitivity (gain) and the phase relationships were estimated by varying the modulation frequency of a given sine-wave. When modulation frequency varied from 1-2 Hz to 14-18 Hz, there was a progressive increase of the gain and a phase advance. The experimental gain curve closely conformed to the response of an ideal linear transducer sensitive to both the intensity and the velocity of the input. The phase advance was instead less than that predicted by the model. No "carrier dependent" variations of gain and phase were detected. Differences among motoneurones regarded both the static gain and the "corner frequency" (a measure of the dynamic sensitivity). In 10 motoneurones, the corner frequency ranged between 5 and 10 Hz},

The observed symbols are first modeled as channel responses in a multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) model, while the channel inputs are conceptually considered sparse positive pulse trains carrying the information about the symbol arising times. Our decomposition approach compensates channel responses and aims at reconstructing the input pulse trains directly. The algorithm is derived first for the overdetermined noiseless MIMO case. A generalized scheme is then provided for the underdetermined mixtures in noisy environments. Although blind, the proposed technique approaches Bayesian optimal linear minimum mean square error estimator and is, hence, significantly noise resistant. The results of simulation tests prove it can be applied to considerably underdetermined convolutive mixtures and even to the mixtures of moderately correlated input pulse trains, with their cross-correlation up to 10{\%} of its maximum possible value.},

If x is known to be compressible by transform coding with a known transform, and we reconstruct via the nonlinear procedure defined here, the number of measurements n can be dramatically smaller than the size m. Thus, certain natural classes of images with m pixels need only n = O(m(1/4) log(5/2)(m)) nonadaptive nonpixel samples for faithful recovery, as opposed to the usual m pixel samples. More specifically, suppose x has a sparse representation in some orthonormal basis (e.g., wavelet, Fourier) or tight frame (e.g., curvelet, Gabor)-so the coefficients belong to an l(p), ball for O {\textless} p {\textless}= 1. The N most important coefficients in that expansion allow reconstruction with l(2) error O(N1/2-1/p). It is possible to design n = O (N log (m)) nonadaptive measurements allowing reconstruction with accuracy comparable to that attainable with direct knowledge of the N most important coefficients. Moreover, a good approximation to those N important coefficients is extracted from the n measurements by solving a linear program-Basis Pursuit in signal processing. The nonadaptive measurements have the character of "random" linear combinations of basis/frame elements. Our results use the notions of optimal recovery, of n-widths, and information-based complexity. We estimate the Gel'fand n-widths of l(p) balls in high-dimensional Euclidean space in the case 0 {\textless} p {\textless}= 1, and give a criterion identifying near-optimal subspaces for Gel'fand n-widths. We show that "most" subspaces are near-optimal, and show that convex optimization (Basis Pursuit) is a near-optimal way to extract information derived from these near-optimal subspaces.},

abstract = {Several models have been employed to study human postural control during upright quiet stance. Most have adopted an inverted pendulum approximation to the standing human and theoretical models to account for the neural feedback necessary to keep balance. The present study adds to the previous efforts in focusing more closely on modelling the physiological mechanisms of important elements associated with the control of human posture. This paper studies neuromuscular mechanisms behind upright stance control by means of a biologically based large-scale neuromusculoskeletal (NMS) model. It encompasses: i) conductance-based spinal neuron models (motor neurons and interneurons); ii) muscle proprioceptor models (spindle and Golgi tendon organ) providing sensory afferent feedback; iii) Hill-type muscle models of the leg plantar and dorsiflexors; and iv) an inverted pendulum model for the body biomechanics during upright stance. The motor neuron pools are driven by stochastic spike trains. Simulation results showed that the neuromechanical outputs generated by the NMS model resemble experimental data from subjects standing on a stable surface. Interesting findings were that: i) an intermittent pattern of muscle activation emerged from this posture control model for two of the leg muscles (Medial and Lateral Gastrocnemius); and ii) the Soleus muscle was mostly activated in a continuous manner. These results suggest that the spinal cord anatomy and neurophysiology (e.g., motor unit types, synaptic connectivities, ordered recruitment), along with the modulation of afferent activity, may account for the mixture of intermittent and continuous control that has been a subject of debate in recent studies on postural control. Another finding was the occurrence of the so-called "paradoxical" behaviour of muscle fibre lengths as a function of postural sway. The simulations confirmed previous conjectures that reciprocal inhibition is possibly contributing to this effect, but on the other hand showed that this effect may arise without any anticipatory neural control mechanism.},

abstract = {Understanding the origin of noise, or variability, in the motor system is an important step towards understanding how accurate movements are performed. Variability of joint torque during voluntary activation is affected by many factors such as the precision of the descending motor commands, the number of muscles that cross the joint, their size and the number of motor units in each. To investigate the relationship between the peripheral factors and motor noise, the maximum voluntary torque produced at a joint and the coefficient of variation of joint torque were recorded from six adult human subjects for four muscle/joint groups in the arm. It was found that the coefficient of variation of torque decreases systematically as the maximum voluntary torque increases. This decreasing coefficient of variation means that a given torque or force can be more accurately generated by a stronger muscle than a weaker muscle. Simulations demonstrated that muscles with different strengths and different numbers of motor units could account for the experimental data. In the simulations, the magnitude of the coefficient of variation of muscle force depended primarily on the number of motor units innervating the muscle, which relates positively to muscle strength. This result can be generalised to the situation where more than one muscle is available to perform a task, and a muscle activation pattern must be selected. The optimal muscle activation pattern required to generate a target torque using a group of muscles, while minimizing the consequences of signal dependent noise, is derived.},

In the presence of the monoamines serotonin and norepinephrine, spinal motoneurons can exhibit bistable behavior, in which a brief period of excitatory input evokes prolonged self-sustained firing. A brief inhibitory input returns the cell to the quiescent state. To determine whether motoneurons differ in their capacity for bistable behavior, intracellular recordings were obtained in the decerebrate cat preparation. To enhance the likelihood of encountering bistable behavior, the noradrenergic $\alpha$1 agonist methoxamine was applied to the ventral surface of the cord. The capacity of the cells to produce bistable behavior was assessed from the duration of self-sustained firing evoked by a brief (1.5 s) excitatory synaptic input from muscle spindle Ia afferents. About 35{\%} (17 of 49) of the cells produced steady self-sustained firing for {\textgreater}3 s and were considered fully bistable. The other 32 cells (∼65{\%}) were partially bistable, with self-sustained firing lasting {\textless}3 s. Fully bistable cells tended to have lower current thresholds for spike initiation and slower axonal conduction velocities than did partially bistable cells. This suggests that fully bistable motoneurons innervate fatigue resistant muscle fibers. The frequency-current (F-I) relations of the motoneurons were characterized with slow triangular current ramps. Fully bistable cells displayed an acceleration in firing rate immediately on initiation of rhythmic firing. The F-I gain after completion of the acceleration was positive. Fully bistable cells also displayed a hysteresis in the current level for firing threshold with the ascending threshold occurring at substantially higher current level than the descending one. Additionally, these current thresholds usually were centered about zero current, so that the ascending current threshold was positive while the descending current threshold was negative. This negative offset meant that fully bistable cells could exhibit tonic firing without depolarizing injected current. Partially bistable cells exhibited very different F-I characteristics. Firing rate acceleration was just as large as in fully bistable cells but did not occur until well above the current level needed to initiate rhythmic firing. F-I gain after acceleration was negative, there was little to no hysteresis between the ascending and descending firing thresholds, and both thresholds were above the zero current level. These properties of partially bistable cells suggest their functional role is in tasks requiring relatively brief, high forces. The low thresholds of fully bistable cells mean they will be readily recruited in low force tasks like posture, where their prolonged self-sustained firing would be advantageous.},

abstract = {1. Intracellular recording and stimulation techniques were used in a comparison of electrical properties of triceps surae and plantaris motoneurons between unlesioned and 6-wk chronic spinal (L1-L2) cats. The primary analysis was restricted to 195 motoneurons with action potential heights {\textgreater} or = 80 mV. 2. Voltage transients resulting from short-duration current pulses (0.5 ms) were used to estimate membrane time constant (tau m) and equivalent cylinder electrotonic length (L). Although L was unchanged, tau m and the equalization phase time constant were significantly lower (17{\%}) in motoneurons from chronic spinal preparations. Estimated total cell surface area was also reduced by 11{\%}. The incidence of sag conductances, as judged from observations of the decay of voltage transients, increased from 3{\%} to 29{\%} after chronic spinalization. 3. Input resistance, as measured from either the amplitude of voltage responses to long-duration (50 ms) hyperpolarizing pulses (RinL) or from the area of the short-duration current pulse-induced voltage transients, was unchanged in the chronic spinal preparation. 4. Rheobase current was unchanged but threshold voltage (V Th) was increased in chronic spinal motoneurons. Increased V Th was not a result of membrane hyperpolarization because both mean action potential height (88 mV) and resting membrane potential (70 mV) were identical in both preparations. 5. The threshold current for action potential activation by short-duration (0.5 ms) current pulses increased 28{\%} in chronic spinal preparations. This is consistent with the increase in V Th in the same motoneurons. 6. Measured V Th was identical to that calculated from the product of RinL and rheobase in the unlesioned preparation but was significantly larger than calculated V Th in chronic spinal preparations. This may indicate an increased incidence or magnitude of subthreshold rectification processes in motoneurons from chronic spinal preparations. These results in barbiturate-anesthetized preparations suggest that ankle extensor motoneurons are less excitable in the chronic spinal state. 7. Mean afterhyperpolarization duration was 10{\%} shorter in motoneurons from chronic spinal preparations, whereas amplitude was unchanged. 8. Electrical properties were also compared in chronic spinal and unlesioned preparations using motoneurons with action potential heights of 60-79 mV. In these motoneurons with presumably poorer impalements there were no significant differences between unlesioned and chronic spinal preparations. 9. Ia monosynaptic excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) recorded in the same motoneurons have decreased half-widths and rise times and increased amplitudes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

abstract = {1. The relationship between the motor unit discharge pattern (rate and variability) and synchronization of motor unit pairs was studied in the first dorsal interosseus muscle of human subjects. In separate trials of up to 4 min duration, subjects voluntarily controlled the mean discharge rate of an identified motor unit at one of several prescribed rates (range 7.5-17.5 Hz). 2. The effect of discharge rate on the synchronous peak in the cross-correlogram was examined in eighty motor unit pairs from six subjects. Five commonly used synchronization indices were used to quantify synchrony in the cross-correlograms constructed from different discharge-rate trials. For each synchronization index, the apparent magnitude of synchrony increased at lower motor unit discharge rates. The synchronization indices were not equally sensitive to discharge rate; increases in the different indices ranged from 72 to 494{\%} between the highest and lowest discharge rates. 3. A model of the membrane potential trajectory underlying rhythmic motoneuron discharge was used to explain the observed increase in the magnitude of the synchronization indices at lower discharge rates. The essential feature of this model is that the probability of a common-input EPSP causing a synchronous discharge in two motoneurons is independent of discharge rate. This means that the number of synchronous action potentials in excess of chance in any trial depends on the properties of the common-input EPSPs and the duration of the trial, but is not related to motor unit discharge rates. The model also demonstrated that when the excess synchronous counts are normalized to motor unit discharge rate, or baseline counts in the histogram (as in the conventional synchronization indices), the magnitude of the index increases when the motor unit discharge rates are low. 4. The strength of common input to motoneurons could be misinterpreted if conventional synchronization indices are used because of discharge-rate effects. The model was used to derive an index of the strength of common input to motoneurons (CIS) that was independent of motor unit discharge rate. CIS is the frequency of synchronous action potentials in the motor unit pair in excess of those expected due to chance (calculated during periods of tonic discharge in both units). The mean CIS in first dorsal interosseus motor unit pairs ranged from 0.052 to 1.005 extra synchronous action potentials per second across subjects. 5. Discharge variability was correlated with each of the synchronization indices and the CIS.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

abstract = {Computational models of motor-unit populations are the objective implementations of the hypothesized mechanisms by which neural and muscle properties give rise to electromyograms (EMGs) and force. However, the variability/uncertainty of the parameters used in these models--and how they affect predictions--confounds assessing these hypothesized mechanisms. We perform a large-scale computational sensitivity analysis on the state-of-the-art computational model of surface EMG, force, and force variability by combining a comprehensive review of published experimental data with Monte Carlo simulations. To exhaustively explore model performance and robustness, we ran numerous iterative simulations each using a random set of values for nine commonly measured motor neuron and muscle parameters. Parameter values were sampled across their reported experimental ranges. Convergence after 439 simulations found that only 3 simulations met our two fitness criteria: approximating the well-established experimental relations for the scaling of EMG amplitude and force variability with mean force. An additional 424 simulations preferentially sampling the neighborhood of those 3 valid simulations converged to reveal 65 additional sets of parameter values for which the model predictions approximate the experimentally known relations. We find the model is not sensitive to muscle properties but very sensitive to several motor neuron properties--especially peak discharge rates and recruitment ranges. Therefore to advance our understanding of EMG and muscle force, it is critical to evaluate the hypothesized neural mechanisms as implemented in today's state-of-the-art models of motor unit function. We discuss experimental and analytical avenues to do so as well as new features that may be added in future implementations of motor-unit models to improve their experimental validity.},

abstract = {Contractile properties of human motor units provide information on the force capacity and fatigability of muscles. The spike-triggered averaging technique (STA) is a conventional method used to estimate the twitch waveform of single motor units in vivo by averaging the joint force signal. Several limitations of this technique have been previously discussed in an empirical way, using simulated and experimental data. In this study, we provide a theoretical analysis of this technique in the frequency domain and describe its intrinsic limitations. By analyzing the analytical expression of STA, first we show that a certain degree of correlation between the motor unit activities prevents an accurate estimation of the twitch force, even from relatively long recordings. Second, we show that the quality of the twitch estimates by STA is highly related to the relative variability of the inter-spike intervals of motor unit action potentials. Interestingly, if this variability is extremely high, correct estimates could be obtained even for high discharge rates. However, for physiological inter-spike interval variability and discharge rate, the technique performs with relatively low estimation accuracy and high estimation variance. Finally, we show that the selection of the triggers that are most distant from the previous and next, which is often suggested, is not an effective way for improving STA estimates and in some cases can even be detrimental. These results show the intrinsic limitations of the STA technique and provide a theoretical framework for the design of new methods for the measurement of motor unit force twitch.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to investigate the possible neurophysiological mechanism of EMG signal silence (premovement silence (PMS)) preceding a ballistic movement in 10 healthy volunteers. The subjects were asked to respond to a flashing light signal by performing a plantar flexion in the ankle as strongly and quickly as possible. The EMG signals from agonists lateral gastrocnemius (LG) and soleus (SO), and antagonist tibialis anterior (TA) were simultaneously recorded together with the force signal. The excitability of spinal ??-motoneuron pools was also determined at various phases of the movement execution by means of H-reflex analysis. Our results indicated that: (a) the maximal rate of force development (dF/dt) was significantly greater in the group of subjects demonstrating clear PMS than that without PMS; and (b) the significant decrease in H-reflex amplitude was observed approximately 40 ms prior to the appearance of PMS of both LG and SO muscles, which preceded the force development by about 50-60 ms. These data suggest that PMS is associated with an enhancement of rapid force development due possibly to optimal motor unit synchrony. The decreased H-reflex amplitude (decreased monosynaptic reflex gain) in the absence of parallel decrease in the surface EMG recording (maintained ??-motoneuron activity) prior to PMS and complete disappearance of selected motor unit activities during PMS also suggest that the presynaptic inhibition and/or disfacilitation are mainly involved for PMS during a ballistic movement. ?? 1994.},

abstract = {—Synchronous motor unit firing instances have been attributed to anatomical inputs shared by motoneurons. Yet, there is a lack of empirical evidence confirming the notion that common inputs elicit synchronization under voluntary conditions. We tested this notion by measuring synchronization between motor unit action potential trains (MUAPTs) as their firing rates progressed within a contraction from a relatively low force level to a higher one. On average, the degree of synchronization decreased as the force increased. The common input notion provides no empirically sup- ported explanation for the observed synchronization behavior. There- fore, we investigated a more probable explanation for synchroniza- tion. Our data set of 17,546 paired MUAPTs revealed that the degree of synchronization varies as a function of two characteristics of the motor unit firing rate: the similarity and the slope as a function of force. Both are measures of the excitation of the motoneurons. As the force generated by the muscle increases, the firing rate slope de- creases, and the synchronization correspondingly decreases. Different muscles have motor units with different firing rate characteristics and display different amounts of synchronization. Although this associa- tion is not proof of causality, it consistently explains our observations and strongly suggests further investigation. So viewed, synchroniza- tion is likely an epiphenomenon, subject to countless unknown neural interactions. As such, synchronous firing instances may not be the product of a specific design and may not serve a specific physiological purpose. Our explanation for synchronization has the advantage of being supported by empirical evidence, whereas the common input does not.},

abstract = {A major goal in neuroscience is to understand how the CNS controls posture and movement in humans. This requires an understanding of individual human motor unit properties and how they interact within the muscle to perform different tasks. This article describes differences and similarities between the contractile properties of human motor units and those of the cat prototype medial gastrocnemius (MG) muscle, on which so many studies have been conducted. The article describes the methods available for measuring human motor unit properties and their limitations, and it discusses how far the behavior of whole muscles can be predicted from their histochemistry. It questions the extent to which human motor units conform to the conventional criteria by which S (slow, fatigue resistant), FR (fast but fatigue resistant) and FF (fast, fatigable) unit types are usually classified. An important difference between human and cat MG data is that weak human motor units are not necessarily slow, nor strong ones fast; that is, generally, human unit force is not correlated with contractile speed. Also, unlike cat MG, the few human muscles studied so far contain few if any FF units but a high proportion of units with intermediate fatigue resistance (Flnt). These apparently aberrant human properties, however, are also found in other cat and rat muscles. Thus, cat MG may not be the best model for motor unit behavior generally. Finally, the influence of human motor unit properties on force output by recruitment and/or rate coding is discussed.},

abstract = {Many scientists write code as part of their research. Just as expriments are logged in laboratory notebooks, it is important to document the code you use for analysis. However, a few key problems can arise when iteratively developing code that make it difficult to document and track which code version was used to create each result. First, you often need to experiment with new ideas, such as adding new features to a script or increasing the speed of a slow step, but you do not want to risk breaking the currently working code. One often-utilized solution is to make a copy of the script before making new edits. However, this can quickly become a problem because it clutters your file system with uninformative filenames, e.g., analisys.sh, analysis{\_}02.sh, analysis{\_}03.sh, etc. It is difficult to remember the differences between the verions of the files and, more importantly, which version you used to produce specific results, especially if you return to the code months later. Second, you will likely share your code with multiple lab mates or collaborators, and they may have suggestions on how to improve it. If you email the code to multiple people, you will have to manually incorporate all the changes of them sends. Fortunately, software engineers have already developed software to manage these issues: version control. A version control system (VCS) allows you to track the iterative changes you make to your code, Thus, you can experiment with new ideas but always have the option to revert to a specific past version of the code you used to generate particular results. Furthermore, you can record messages as you save each successive version so that you (or anyone else) reviewing the development history of the code is able to understand the rationale for the given edits. It also facilitates collaboration. Using a VCS, your collaborators can make and save changes to the code, and you can automatically incorporate these changes to the main code base. The collaborative aspect is enhanced with the emergence of websites that host version-controlled code.},

abstract = {A Web-based simulation system of the spinal cord circuitry responsible for muscle control is described. The simulator employs two-compartment motoneuron models for S, FR and FF types, with synaptic inputs acting through conductance variations. Four motoneuron pools with their associated interneurons are represented in the simulator, with the possibility of inclusion of more than 2,000 neurons and 2,000,000 synapses. Each motoneuron action potential is followed, after a conduction delay, by a motor unit potential and a motor unit twitch. The sums of all motor unit potentials and twitches result in the electromyogram (EMG), and the muscle force, respectively. Inputs to the motoneuron pool come from populations of interneurons (Ia reciprocal inhibitory interneurons, Ib interneurons, and Renshaw cells) and from stochastic point processes associated with descending tracts. To simulate human electrophysiological experiments, the simulator incorporates external nerve stimulation with orthodromic and antidromic propagation. This provides the mechanisms for reflex generation and activation of spinal neuronal circuits that modulate the activity of another motoneuron pool (e.g., by reciprocal inhibition). The generation of the H-reflex by the Ia-motoneuron pool system and its modulation by spinal cord interneurons is included in the simulation system. Studies with the simulator may include the statistics of individual motoneuron or interneuron spike trains or the collective effect of a motor nucleus on the dynamics of muscle force control. Properties associated with motor-unit recruitment, motor-unit synchronization, recurrent inhibition and reciprocal inhibition may be investigated.},

abstract = {Movement, the fundamental component of behavior and the principal extrinsic action of the brain, is produced when skeletal muscles contract and relax in response to patterns of action potentials generated by motoneurons. The processes that determine the firing behavior of motoneurons are therefore important in understanding the transformation of neural activity to motor behavior. Here, we review recent studies on the control of motoneuronal excitability, focusing on synaptic and cellular properties. We first present a background description of motoneurons: their development, anatomical organization, and membrane properties, both passive and active. We then describe the general anatomical organization of synaptic input to motoneurons, followed by a description of the major transmitter systems that affect motoneuronal excitability, including ligands, receptor distribution, pre- and postsynaptic actions, signal transduction, and functional role. Glutamate is the main excitatory, and GABA and glycine are the main inhibitory transmitters acting through ionotropic receptors. These amino acids signal the principal motor commands from peripheral, spinal, and supraspinal structures. Amines, such as serotonin and norepinephrine, and neuropeptides, as well as the glutamate and GABA acting at metabotropic receptors, modulate motoneuronal excitability through pre- and postsynaptic actions. Acting principally via second messenger systems, their actions converge on common effectors, e.g., leak K+ current, cationic inward current, hyperpolarization-activated inward current, Ca2+channels, or presynaptic release processes. Together, these numerous inputs mediate and modify incoming motor commands, ultimately generating the coordinated firing patterns that underlie muscle contractions during motor behavior.},

@article{Watanabe2015,
abstract = {Oscillations in the beta and gamma bands (13-30 Hz; 35-70 Hz) have often been observed in motor cortical outputs that reach the spinal cord, acting on motoneurons and interneurons. However, the frequencies of these oscillations are above the muscle force frequency range. A current view is that the transformation of the motoneuron pool inputs into force is linear. For this reason possible roles for these oscillations are unclear, since if this transformation is linear, the high frequencies in the motoneuron inputs (e.g., 20 Hz from pyramidal tract neurons) would be filtered out by the muscle and have no effect on force control. A biologically inspired mathematical model of the neuromuscular system was used to investigate the impact of high-frequency cortical oscillatory activity on force control. The model simulation results evidenced that a typical motoneuron pool has a nonlinear behavior that enables the decoding of a high-frequency oscillatory input. An input at a single frequency (e.g., beta band) leads to an increase in the steady-state force generated by the muscle. When the input oscillation was amplitude modulated at a given low frequency, the force oscillated at this frequency. In both cases, the mechanism relies on the recruitment and derecruitment of motor units in response to the oscillatory descending drive. Therefore, the results from this study suggest a potential role in force control for cortical oscillations at frequencies at or above the beta band, despite the low-pass behavior of the muscles. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The role of cortical oscillations in motor control has been a long-standing question, one view being that they are an epiphenomenon. Fast oscillations are known to reach the spinal cord, and hence they have been thought to affect muscle behavior. However, experimental limitations have hampered further advances to explain how they could influence muscle force. An approach for such a challenge was adopted in the present research: to study the problem through computer simulations of an advanced biologically compatible mathematical model. Using such a model, we found that the well-known mechanism of recruitment and derecruitment of the spinal cord motoneurons can allow the muscle to respond to cortical oscillations, suggesting that these oscillations are not epiphenomena in motor control.},

Over the ensuing decades, these approaches have led to a massive development of increasingly accurate and complex data-based models of neurons and neuronal circuits. ModelDB was founded in 1996 to support this new field and enhance the scientific credibility and utility of computational neuroscience models by providing a convenient venue for sharing them. It has grown to include over 1100 published models covering more than 130 research topics. It is actively curated and developed to help researchers discover and understand models of interest. ModelDB also provides mechanisms to assist running models both locally and remotely, and has a graphical tool that enables users to explore the anatomical and biophysical properties that are represented in a model. Each of its capabilities is undergoing continued refinement and improvement in response to user experience. Large research groups (Allen Brain Institute, EU Human Brain Project, etc.) are emerging that collect data across multiple scales and integrate that data into many complex models, presenting new challenges of scale. We end by predicting a future for neuroscience increasingly fueled by new technology and high performance computation, and increasingly in need of comprehensive user-friendly databases such as ModelDB to provide the means to integrate the data for deeper insights into brain function in health and disease.},

abstract = {Embedding computational models in the physical world is a critical step towards constraining their behavior and building practical applications. Here we aim to drive a realistic musculoskeletal arm model using a biomimetic cortical spiking model, and make a robot arm reproduce the same trajectories in real time. Our cortical model consisted of a 3-layered cortex, composed of several hundred spiking model-neurons, which display physiologically realistic dynamics. We interconnected the cortical model to a two-joint musculoskeletal model of a human arm, with realistic anatomical and biomechanical properties. The virtual arm received muscle excitations from the neuronal model, and fed back proprioceptive information, forming a closed-loop system. The cortical model was trained using spike timing-dependent reinforcement learning to drive the virtual arm in a 2D reaching task. Limb position was used to simultaneously control a robot arm using an improved network interface. Virtual arm muscle activations responded to motoneuron firing rates, with virtual arm muscles lengths encoded via population coding in the proprioceptive population. After training, the virtual arm performed reaching movements which were smoother and more realistic than those obtained using a simplistic arm model. This system provided access to both spiking network properties and to arm biophysical properties, including muscle forces. The use of a musculoskeletal virtual arm and the improved control system allowed the robot arm to perform movements which were smoother than those reported in our previous paper using a simplistic arm. This work provides a novel approach consisting of bidirectionally connecting a cortical model to a realistic virtual arm, and using the system output to drive a robotic arm in real time. Our techniques are applicable to the future development of brain neuro-prosthetic control systems, and may enable enhanced brain-machine interfaces with the possibility for finer control of limb prosthetics.},

abstract = {During voluntary contrac- tion, firing rates of individual motor units (MUs) increase modestly over a narrow force range beyond which little additional increase in firing rate is seen. Such saturation of MU discharge may be a consequence of extrinsic factors that limit net synaptic excitation acting on motor neurons (MNs) or may be due to intrinsic properties of the MNs. Two sets of experiments involving recording of human biceps brachii MUs were carried out to evaluate saturation. In the first set, the extent of saturation was quantified for 136 low-threshold MUs during isometric ramp contractions. Firing rate-force data were best fit by a saturating function for 90{\%} of MUs recorded with a maximum rate of 14.8 ? 2.0 impulses/s. In the second set of experiments, to distinguish extrinsic from intrinsic factors underlying saturation, we artificially augmented descending excitatory drive to biceps MNs by activation of muscle spindle afferents through tendon vibration. We examined the change in firing rate caused by tendon vibration in 96 MUs that were voluntarily activated at rates below and at saturation. Vibration had little effect on the discharge of MUs that were firing at saturation frequencies but strongly increased firing rates of the same units when active at lower frequencies. These results indicate that saturation is likely caused by intrinsic mechanisms that prevent further increases in firing rate in the presence of increasing synaptic excitation. Possible intrinsic cellular mechanisms that limit firing rates of motor units during voluntary effort are discussed.},

abstract = {Membrane electrical properties [time constant, action potential afterhyperpolarization (AHP), rheobase, input resistance, and axonal conduction velocity] were measured in motoneurons of cat medial gastrocnemius (MG) motor units. Motor units were classified on the basis of their mechanical responses as fast twitch, fast fatiguing (FF); fast twitch with intermediate fatigue resistance (FI); fast twitch, fatigue resistant (FR); or slow twitch, fatigue resistant (S; 11, 22). Motoneuron membrane time constant, estimated from the voltage response at the onset or termination of long (50-100 ms) current pulses and corrected for voltage-response nonlinearities (32), was found to differ significantly among the major motor-unit types, increasing in the order FF less than FR less than S. Afterhyperpolarization magnitude, half-decay time, and duration were all significantly greater for the fast (FF + FI + FR) versus the slow (S) motor units. The AHP half-decay time was correlated with muscle unit twitch time over the entire motoneuron population and within the type S motor-unit population. There was no significant correlation between twitch time and AHP half-decay time among the types FF and FR motor-unit populations. In agreement with previous studies, we found a significant difference in both rheobase and input resistance among the major motor-unit types, with rheobase increasing in the order S less than FR less than FF and input resistance decreasing in that order (S greater than FR greater than FF). The differences in input resistance were present both before and after correcting for voltage-response nonlinearities (32). Also in agreement with previous studies, the mean axonal conduction velocity was significantly faster among the fast (FF + FI + and FR) compared with the slow (S) motor units. These data were used to examine the properties alone to determine motor-unit type, which has traditionally been defined on the basis of the muscle unit's mechanical properties (11, 22). We used a discriminant analysis program to classify 73 mechanically typed motor units for which we had measures of rheobase, input resistance, membrane time constant, and AHP half-decay time. This model was able to properly classify 71 of the 73 motor units of this data set, indicating that the motor units of this data set could be grouped into three categories representing the three major motor-unit types (FF, FR, and S) on the basis of their rheobase, input resistance, membrane time constant, and AHP half-decay time.},

(2) The mean amplitudes of the PMSP MEPs in the flexor carpi radialis were significantly smaller than the non-PMSP MEPs, whereas the mean amplitude of the PMSP H-reflex was not significantly different from the non-PMSP H-reflex. (3) In the soleus muscle, the change in MEPs and H-reflexes was examined at three periods for 0-150 ms before the rapid movements. The mean amplitudes of PMSP MEPs for the -150- to -100-ms period and for the -50- to -5-ms period were significantly smaller than those of non-PMSP MEPs. On the other hand, the differences of the mean amplitudes between PMSP H-reflex and non-PMSP H-reflex at the three periods were not significant. (4) These findings suggested that the cortical sensitivity to the TMS was decreased during PMSP though the spinal inhibitory mechanisms assess by H-reflex was not altered during the PMSP and that the EMG pause of the PMSP originates not at the spinal level but at the cortical level. The data support the hypothesis that PMSP is preprogrammed in the preparation and initiation process of the voluntary movements aimed at reinforcement of the performance of the subsequent ballistic movements. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {We used surface EMG signal decomposition technology to study the control properties of numerous simultaneously active motor units. Six healthy human subjects of comparable age (21 +/- 0.63 yr) and physical fitness were recruited to perform isometric contractions of the vastus lateralis (VL), first dorsal interosseous (FDI), and tibialis anterior (TA) muscles at the 20, 50, 80, and 100{\%} maximum voluntary contraction force levels. EMG signals were collected with a five-pin surface array sensor that provided four channels of data. They were decomposed into the constituent action potentials with a new decomposition algorithm. The firings of a total of 1,273 motor unit action potential trains, 20-30 per contraction, were obtained. The recruitment thresholds and mean firing rates of the motor units were calculated, and mathematical equations were derived. The results describe a hierarchical inverse relationship between the recruitment thresholds and the firing rates, including the first and second derivatives, i.e., the velocity and the acceleration of the firing rates. This relationship describes an "operating point" for the motoneuron pool that remains consistent at all force levels and is modulated by the excitation. This relationship differs only slightly between subjects and more distinctly across muscles. These results support the "onion skin" property that suggests a basic control scheme encoded in the physical properties of motoneurons that responds consistently to a "common drive" to the motoneuron pool.},

abstract = {Coherence analysis is widely employed to study the correlation between discharge times of simultaneously active motor units. Despite the widespread application of the technique, it has not been fully established how the characteristics of the observed coherence are related to the properties of the shared motoneuron inputs. In addition, the exact relationship between coherence and traditional measures of motor unit synchronization remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to examine the influence of shared motoneuron inputs on coherence between motor unit discharge patterns using computer simulations. Although less sensitive to motor unit firing rates than traditional synchronization-based indices, coherence tended to decrease with increasing frequency of the common input and to increase slightly when the common input frequency was close to the motor unit firing rates. In addition, coherence tended to be highest between motor units with similar firing rates. A linear association was observed between synchronization and coherence in the 15-30 Hz range and between 'common drive' and coherence in the 0-5 Hz range. The results suggest that caution should be taken when interpreting differences in coherence observed between motor units with significantly different firing properties or when comparing data with coherence in different frequency ranges. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {This study focuses on neuromuscular mechanisms behind ankle torque and EMG variability during a maintained isometric plantar flexion contraction. Experimentally obtained torque standard deviation (SD) and soleus, medial gastrocnemius, and lateral gastrocnemius EMG envelope mean and SD increased with mean torque for a wide range of torque levels. Computer simulations were performed on a biophysically-based neuromuscular model of the triceps surae consisting of premotoneuronal spike trains (the global input, GI) driving the motoneuron pools of the soleus, medial gastrocnemius, and lateral gastrocnemius muscles, which activate their respective muscle units. Two types of point processes were adopted to represent the statistics of the GI: Poisson and Gamma. Simulations showed a better agreement with experimental results when the GI was modeled by Gamma point processes having lower orders (higher variability) for higher target torques. At the same time, the simulations reproduced well the experimental data of EMG envelope mean and SD as a function of mean plantar flexion torque, for the three muscles. These results suggest that the experimentally found relations between torque-EMG variability as a function of mean plantar flexion torque level depend not only on the intrinsic properties of the motoneuron pools and the muscle units innervated, but also on the increasing variability of the premotoneuronal GI spike trains when their mean rates increase to command a higher plantar flexion torque level. The simulations also provided information on spike train statistics of several hundred motoneurons that compose the triceps surae, providing a wide picture of the associated mechanisms behind torque and EMG variability.},

Although the twitch tensions were generally largest for the abduction contraction, all units contributed tension to all three directions of contraction. A linear correlation was found for twitch tensions of motor units for the three directions of static contractions. Linear correlations were also found between twitch tension and threshold force of these motor units for each direction, which suggests that an orderly pattern of recruitment, according to increasing twitch size, adequately describes the function of human first dorsal interosseous muscle for all contraction directions. No clear evidence was found for separate groups of motor units in the muscle that were selectively activated for the different tasks. Rank order of recruitment for motor units in the three directions of contraction was correlated, but was not identical. The scatter in our data is discussed in relation to earlier reports of altered motor-unit recruitment during different movements.},

abstract = {We constructed a physiologically plausible computationally efficient model of a motor unit and developed simulation software that allows for integrative investigations of the input-output processing in the motor unit system. The model motor unit was first built by coupling the motoneuron model and muscle unit model to a simplified axon model. To build the motoneuron model, we used a recently reported two-compartment modeling approach that accurately captures the key cell-type-related electrical properties under both passive conditions (somatic input resistance, membrane time constant and signal attenuation properties between the soma and the dendrites) and active conditions (rheobase current and afterhyperpolarization duration at the soma and plateau behavior at the dendrites). To construct the muscle unit, we used a recently developed muscle modeling approach that reflects the experimentally identified dependencies of muscle activation dynamics on isometric, isokinetic and dynamic variation in muscle length over a full range of stimulation frequencies. Then, we designed the simulation software based on the object-oriented programing paradigm and developed the software using open-source Python language to be fully operational using graphical user interfaces. Using the developed software, separate simulations could be performed for a single motoneuron, muscle unit and motor unit under a wide range of experimental input protocols, and a hierarchical analysis could be performed from a single channel to the entire system behavior. Our model motor unit and simulation software may represent efficient tools not only for researchers studying the neural control of force production from a cellular perspective but also for instructors and students in motor physiology classroom settings.},

abstract = {In anaesthetized cats, thresholds for long (rheobase) and brief duration current pulses have been obtained from spinal motoneurones and compared with other cell parameters and membrane properties. Rheobase showed only weak over-all relationships with conduction velocity and with cell size, estimated as the total capacitance of individual motoneuronal equivalent cylinders. Rheobase showed a clear tendency to vary inversely with after-hyperpolarization (a.h.p.) duration and was strongly correlated with the input conductance and with the inverse of the membrane time constant. However, the range of rheobase current exceeded that of input conductance by almost a factor of 2. Part of this range discrepancy arose because threshold depolarization tended to increase with rheobase current. Thus, among motoneurones grouped according to rheobase magnitude (three groups), those within the lowest rheobase group had threshold depolarizations about 6 mV on average lower than those within the highest rheobase group. Even though this difference was not directly related to resting potential differences between the groups, further analysis suggested that it may have arisen secondarily to impalement-induced depolarization. The finding that experimentally estimated threshold depolarizations in individual motoneurones were generally larger than those predicted by the product of input resistance and rheobase indicated that a subthreshold rectification process also contributed to the range of rheobase. The difference was largest in the low-rheobase group and smallest in the high-rheobase group. Because these differences were proportional to the differences in input resistance between the separate motoneurone groups, it is suggested that the magnitude of the current underlying the rectification process does not differ systematically among motoneurones. Within groups of motoneurones classified on the basis of rheobase or a.h.p. duration, significant correlations existed between rheobase current and input conductance. An analysis of variance indicated that even within such functional subgroups of motoneurones, rheobase was appreciably better correlated with membrane time constant than with estimated cell size. Although showing a range approximately half that of rheobase, the brief current threshold was similar to rheobase in its relations with total cell capacitance, a.h.p. duration and the inverse of membrane time constant.},

abstract = {Computation is becoming essential across all sciences, for data acquisition and analysis, automa-tion, and hypothesis testing via modeling and simulation. As a consequence, software development is becoming a critical scientific activity. Training of scientists in programming, software devel-opment, and computational thinking (Wilson, 2006), choice of tools, community-building and interoperability are all issues that should be addressed, if we wish to accelerate scientific progress while maintaining standards of correctness and reproducibility. The Python programming language in particular has seen a surge in popularity across the sci-ences, for reasons which include its readability, modularity, and large standard library. The use of Python as a scientific programming language began to increase with the development of numer-ical libraries for optimized operations on large arrays in the late 1990s, in which an important development was the merging of the competing Numeric and Numarray packages in 2006 to form NumPy (Oliphant, 2007). As Python and NumPy have gained traction in a given scientific domain, we have seen the emergence of domain-specific ecosystems of open-source Python software devel-oped by scientists. It became clear to us in 2007 that we were on the cusp of an emerging Python in neuroscience ecosystem, particularly in computational neuroscience and neuroimaging, but also in electrophysiological data analysis and in psychophysics. Two major strengths of Python are its modularity and ability to easily " glue " together different programming languages, which together facilitate the interaction of modular components and their composition into larger systems. This focus on reusable components, which has proven its value in commercial and open-source software development (Brooks, 1987), is, we contend, essential for scientific computing in neuroscience, if we are to cope with the increasingly large amounts of data being produced in experimental labs, and if we wish to understand and model the brain in all its complexity. We therefore felt that it was timely and important to raise awareness of the emerging Python in Neuroscience software ecosystem amongst researchers developing Python-based tools, but also in the larger neuroscience community. Our goals were several-fold: -establish a critical mass for Python use and development in the eyes of the community; -encourage interoperability and collaboration between developers; -expose neuroscientists to the new Python-based tools now available.},

The technique has gained widespread acceptance, and been widely used to investigate the strength of synaptic connections in the mammalian central nervous system (e.g. Watt et al., 1976; Stauffer et al., 1976; Kirkwood and Sears, 1980; Cope et al., 1987), leading to new insights and an increased understanding of basic neurophysiological mechanisms.},

The twitch tensions produced by motor units varied widely from about 0{\textperiodcentered}1–10 g. The twitch tension of a motor unit varied nearly linearly as a function of the level of voluntary force at which it was recruited over the entire range of forces studied (0–2 kg). 3. The number of additional motor units recruited during a given increment in force declined sharply at high levels of voluntary force. This suggests that even though the high threshold units generate more tension, the contribution of recruitment to increases in voluntary force declines at higher force levels. 4. Contraction times for these motor units varied from 30 to 100 msec. Over 80{\%} had contraction times less than 70 msec, and might be classed as fast twitch motor units.

The observed symbols are first modeled as channel responses in a multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) model, while the channel inputs are conceptually considered sparse positive pulse trains carrying the information about the symbol arising times. Our decomposition approach compensates channel responses and aims at reconstructing the input pulse trains directly. The algorithm is derived first for the overdetermined noiseless MIMO case. A generalized scheme is then provided for the underdetermined mixtures in noisy environments. Although blind, the proposed technique approaches Bayesian optimal linear minimum mean square error estimator and is, hence, significantly noise resistant. The results of simulation tests prove it can be applied to considerably underdetermined convolutive mixtures and even to the mixtures of moderately correlated input pulse trains, with their cross-correlation up to 10{\%} of its maximum possible value.},

abstract = {To examine the factors affecting the control of human motor units, rate coding strategies of the motor units were investigated in upper limb and intrinsic hand muscles during voluntary isometric contraction of steady force levels up to 80{\%} of maximal voluntary contraction. Numerous spike trains from single motor units were recorded from the m. first dorsal interosseous (17131) and the m. biceps brachii (BB) of eight human subjects by means of tungsten micro-electrodes, and the mean firing rate (MFR) was calculated for each subject and inter-individual comparisons made. The MFRs of the FDI were larger than that of the BB at the higher force level, and substantial differences were not found between these muscles at the lower force level. The slope of the linear regression line of MFRS vs. exerted forces for the FDI was more than twice that for the BB. Therefore, isometric force control of the FDl depends more on the rate coding strategy. The difference in rate coding between the FDI and BB motor units may be determined by factors other than muscle fiber composition, because both muscles are known to possess a similar composition of fiber types. Possible mechanisms underlying these characteristics of rate coding strategy are considered in this report.},

abstract = {1. After application of the noradrenergic alpha 1 agonist methoxamine, muscle spindle Ia input evoked bistable firing patterns (i.e., persistent discharges after Ia input ceased) in adult spinal motoneurons in the decerebrate cat preparation. These bistable discharge patterns were compared with the Ia currents generated in voltage-clamp conditions. 2. During voltage clamp at depolarized holding potentials, the Ia effective synaptic current underwent strong amplification. In those cells with strong bistable firing, a prolonged tail current followed the Ia input. Because the voltage clamp held the behavior of somatic conductances constant, these data indicate that voltage-sensitive conductances in the motoneuron dendrites made an important contribution to bistable firing.},

abstract = {SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS I. Cat spinal motoneurons were studied during penicillin-(PCN) induced spinal sei-zures using constant-current stimulation and voltage-clamp techniques. 2. Normal motoneurons have a voltage-dependent persistent inward current (Ii) 7 probably carried by calcium ions. Zi is the dominant active current at membrane poten-tials lo-30 mV positive to resting potential, resulting in a steady current-voltage (Z-V) curve with an N shape. Zi is not net inward in most motoneurons in the absence of PCN. 3. Voltage-clamp studies show that pro-longed, PCN-induced bursting occurs only in cells possessing a persistent net-inward Zi as potentials lo-30 mV positive to rest-ing potential. A net-inward Zi is seen in 63{\%} of the cells during PCN-induced seizures, compared to 40{\%} of normal cells. Reasons are given for believing at least 80{\%} of the cells undamaged by impalement possess a net-inward Zi during PCN-induced seizures. 4. Direct measurement of spontaneous and evoked synaptic currents during PCN-induced seizures reveals that their duration is not sufficient to sustain spontaneous bursts, which frequently last several seconds in cells having a net-inward Zi. Thus, the prolonged bursts musts be sustained by a mechanism other than synaptic current. 5. A remarkable moment-to-moment fluc-tuation of Ii and ZK was observed during PCN-induced bursting. This fluctuation con-sisted of a decrease in Zk, which always pre-ceded or was associated with the concomi-tant appearance of a net-inward Zi and episodes of prolonged bursting. The decrease of ZK and enhancement of Ii during these episodes was associated with a positive shift in potassium equilibrium potential (Ek). 6. The enhancement of Zi from net out-ward to net inward, which is necessary for prolonged bursting, could be explained by a decrease in leakage current (I,) or ZK or an increase in Zi. No change occurred in IL before and after the onset of bursting be-havior. No change in gk or g,, could be detected after PCN iontophoresis onto single neurons, and published data suggest E-Z{\&} decreases during PCN-induced seizures. Therefore, the decrease in Zk and increase in Zi is best explained by the depolarizing shift Of{\&} 7. To test the hypothesis that the small depolarizing shift in J!?K allows Zi to dominate neuronal behavior, EK, and therefore Zk, were changed by two procedures: a) dis-placing [K]i with tetramethylammonium (TMA) ions, and b) increasing [K], by ex-tracellular iontophoresis of potassium. In both cases, near-steady-state Z-V curves showing only a small amount of anomalous rectification changed to N-shaped curves. The negative slope conductance was only transient with K+ iontophoresis, but after TMA injection, self-sustained bursting could be repeatedly evoked and terminated with polarizing currents. 8. A scheme is presented postulating an interaction of synaptic and membrane mech-anisms that allows Ii to dominate neuronal electrical behavior. Our findings suggest that such a mechanism underlies the spread of seizure activity through normal neural tissue.},

abstract = {Introduction: The learning of core concepts in neuroscience can be reinforced by a hands-on approach, either experimental or computer-based. In this work, we present a web-based multi-scale neuromuscular simulator that is being used as a teaching aid in a campus-wide course on the Principles of Neuroscience. Methods: The simulator has several built-in individual models based on cat and human biophysics, which are interconnected to represent part of the neuromuscular system that controls leg muscles. Examples of such elements are i) single neurons, representing either motor neurons or interneurons mediating reciprocal, recurrent and Ib inhibition; ii) afferent fibers that can be stimulated to generate spinal reflexes; iii) muscle unit models, generating force and electromyogram; and iv) stochastic inputs, representing the descending volitional motor drive. Results: Several application examples are provided in the present report, ranging from studies of individual neuron responses to the collective action of many motor units controlling muscle force generation. A subset of them was included in an optional homework assignment for Neuroscience and Biomedical Engineering graduate students enrolled in the course cited above at our University. Almost all students rated the simulator as a good or an excellent learning tool, and approximately 90{\%} declared that they would use the simulator in future projects. Conclusion: The results allow us to conclude that multi-scale neuromuscular simulator is an effective teaching tool. Special features of this free teaching resource are its direct usability from any browser (http://remoto.leb.usp.br/), its user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) and the preset demonstrations.},

@article{chan2001contractile,
abstract = {The primary function of skeletal muscle is to produce force for postural control and movement. Although the contractile properties of the whole muscle are useful functional indicators, they do not accurately reflect the heterogeneity of the constituent motor units (MUs) and their changes in health and disease. However, data on the contractile properties of human MUs, in comparison to other animal species, are relatively sparse. This, in part, is due to greater methodological challenges of in vivo studies of MUs in the human. The purpose of this review is to critically appraise the methods used in humans; to describe the normative data from different muscle groups; to discuss differences between data from healthy humans and other animal species; and, last, to characterize changes of the MU contractile properties in aging, disease, and in response to intervention. Because the spike-triggered averaging technique can only be used to study the twitch properties, other methods were subsequently developed to measure a wider range of contractile properties. Although there is general agreement between human data and those from other animal species, major differences do exist. Potential reasons for these discrepancies include true biological differences, but differences in the techniques used may also be responsible. Although limited, measurement of MU contractile properties in humans has provided insight into the changes associated with aging and motoneuronal diseases and provides a means of gauging their adaptive capacity for training and immobilization. {\textcopyright} 2001 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Inc.

@article{Dai2002,
abstract = {During fictive locomotion the excitability of adult cat lumbar motoneurones is increased by a reduction (a mean hyperpolarization of approximately 6.0 mV) of voltage threshold (Vth) for action potential (AP) initiation that is accompanied by only small changes in AP height and width. Further examination of the experimental data in the present study confirms that Vth lowering is present to a similar degree in both the hyperpolarized and depolarized portions of the locomotor step cycle. This indicates that Vth reduction is a modulation of motoneurone membrane currents throughout the locomotor state rather than being related to the phasic synaptic input within the locomotor cycle. Potential ionic mechanisms of this locomotor-state-dependent increase in excitability were examined using three five-compartment models of the motoneurone innervating slow, fast fatigue resistant and fast fatigable muscle fibres. Passive and active membrane conductances were set to produce input resistance, rheobase, afterhyperpolarization (AHP) and membrane time constant values similar to those measured in adult cat motoneurones in non-locomoting conditions. The parameters of 10 membrane conductances were then individually altered in an attempt to replicate the hyperpolarization of Vth that occurs in decerebrate cats during fictive locomotion. The goal was to find conductance changes that could produce a greater than 3 mV hyperpolarization of Vth with only small changes in AP height ({\textless} 3 mV) and width ({\textless} 1.2 ms). Vth reduction without large changes in AP shape could be produced either by increasing fast sodium current or by reducing delayed rectifier potassium current. The most effective Vth reductions were achieved by either increasing the conductance of fast sodium channels or by hyperpolarizing the voltage dependency of their activation. These changes were particularly effective when localized to the initial segment. Reducing the conductance of delayed rectifier channels or depolarizing their activation produced similar but smaller changes in Vth. Changes in current underlying the AHP, the persistent Na(+) current, three Ca(2+) currents, the "h" mixed cation current, the "A" potassium current and the leak current were either ineffective in reducing Vth or also produced gross changes in the AP. It is suggested that the increased excitability of motoneurones during locomotion could be readily accomplished by hyperpolarizing the voltage dependency of fast sodium channels in the axon hillock by a hitherto unknown neuromodulatory action.},

The model is an integration of a biologically realistic neural network consisting of motoneurons and interneurons, modeling 12 populations of spinal neurons, and a one degree-of-freedom musculoskeletal model, including proprioceptors. The model could mimic the findings of human postural experiments, using presynaptic inhibition of the Ia afferents to modulate the feedback gains. In a pathological case, disabling one specific neural connection between the inhibitory interneurons and the motoneurons could mimic the experimental findings in complex regional pain syndrome patients. It is concluded that the model is a valuable tool to gain insight into the spinal contributions to human motor control. Applications lay in the fields of human motor control and neurological disorders, where hypotheses on motor dysfunction can be tested, like spasticity, clonus, and tremor.},

The first dorsal interosseous and biceps brachii muscles were studied in 10 healthy subjects and 9 patients with ALS. Following the acquisition of a maximum M wave, needle- and surface-detected EMGs were collected simultaneously during 30-second contractions performed at 10{\%} of the maximum voluntary contraction force to obtain motor unit potential (MUP) trains. DQEMG was then used to extract the surface-detected MUP associated with each MUP train, the mean size of which was divided into the maximum M wave to obtain a MUNE. The results suggest that quantitative electrophysiological data obtained using DQEMG are representative of the pathophysiological changes in the lower motor system in ALS patients, supporting its use in studies documenting the natural history and progression of the disease.},

We utilized transcranial magnetic stimulation to assess changes in flexor carpi radialis (FCR) intracortical facilitation (ICF), and short- and long-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI and LICI) in healthy humans undergoing 3 weeks of immobilization. Measurements were obtained at rest and during contraction (15{\%} intensity). Central activation and the Hoffman reflex (H-reflex) were also assessed. Strength decreased 43.2{\%} +/- 6.1{\%} following immobilization, and central activation also decreased (97.5{\%} +/- 2.4{\%} to 73.2{\%} +/- 8.3{\%}). No changes in ICF, SICI, or LICI were observed at rest; however, LICI was increased during contraction (67.5{\%} +/- 6.9{\%} to 53.1{\%} +/- 6.7{\%} of unconditioned response). The increase in LICI correlated with the loss of strength (r = -0.63). The H-reflex increased following immobilization. These findings suggest that immobilization increases intracortical inhibition during contraction, and this increase is primarily mediated by GABA(B) receptors.},

abstract = {Motoneuron discharge patterns reflect the interaction of synaptic inputs with intrinsic conductances. Recent work has focused on the contribution of conductances mediating persistent inward currents (PICs), which amplify and prolong the effects of synaptic inputs on motoneuron discharge. Certain features of human motor unit discharge are thought to reflect a relatively stereotyped activation of PICs by excitatory synaptic inputs; these features include rate saturation and de-recruitment at a lower level of net excitation than that required for recruitment. However, PIC activation is also influenced by the pattern and spatial distribution of inhibitory inputs that are activated concurrently with excitatory inputs. To estimate the potential contributions of PIC activation and synaptic input patterns to motor unit discharge patterns, we examined the responses of a set of cable motoneuron models to different patterns of excitatory and inhibitory inputs. The models were first tuned to approximate the current- and voltage-clamp responses of low- and medium-threshold spinal motoneurons studied in decerebrate cats and then driven with different patterns of excitatory and inhibitory inputs. The responses of the models to excitatory inputs reproduced a number of features of human motor unit discharge. However, the pattern of rate modulation was strongly influenced by the temporal and spatial pattern of concurrent inhibitory inputs. Thus, even though PIC activation is likely to exert a strong influence on firing rate modulation, PIC activation in combination with different patterns of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs can produce a wide variety of motor unit discharge patterns.},

An exciting application of HMI is the active control of robotic limbs that substitute lost body parts (bionic reconstruction).Despite recent progresses in brain-computer interfacing [1], muscle electrical potentials are still the most important input for clinical HMI. The ensemble electrical activity of a muscle, the electromyogram (EMG), is generated by the neural activation of the motor neurons innervating the muscle and thus contains information on the neural control of movement. Muscle recordings can be performed noninvasively (surface EMG) by electrodes located on the skin to record the electrical activity of the underlying muscle fibers. This recording modality has advantages compared to other HMI modalities, such as those based on implanted electrodes, in terms of long-term stability, biocompatibility, reduced risks of infections, and ethical constraints.},

The model was conceived as a symmetrical controller of a pair of antagonistic muscles, within the behavioral domain of the stretch and Golgi-tendon-organ reflexes, and was scaled to include realistic numbers of motoneurons. Inputs to the model were fiber populations providing random synaptic drive to some of the populations and sensory stimuli appropriate for the reflexes. The resulting model contained roughly 2300 neurons in six pairs of populations. The total number of connections in the model was about 600 000, and individual postsynaptic potentials were small (0.1–0.6 mV). Model responses were calibrated by examination of their ability to reproduce known aspects of the reflexes. Published algorithms were used to construct the environment, which is easily expandable, in terms of membrane channels, neuronal geometry, and synaptic properties. The system was built to combine a system-level perspective of spinal circuitry with the single-unit perspective common in electrophysiological investigation. It provides a computational tool for system-level investigations of spinal cord similar to the tools available at the level of membrane currents.},

abstract = {Muscle force is modulated by varying the number of active motor units and their firing rates. For the past five decades, the notion that the magnitude of the firing rates is directly related to motor unit size and recruitment threshold has been widely accepted. This construct, here named the After-hyperpolarization scheme evolved from observations in electrically stimulated cat motoneurons and from reported observations in voluntary contractions in humans. It supports the assumption that the firing rates of motor units match their mechanical properties to "optimize" force production, so that the firing rate range corresponds to that required for force-twitch fusion (tetanization) and effective graduation of muscle force. In contrast, we have shown that, at any time and force during isometric voluntary constant-force contractions in humans, the relationship between firing rate and recruitment threshold is inversely related. We refer to this construct as the Onion-Skin scheme because earlier-recruited motor units always have greater firing rates than latter-recruited ones. By applying a novel mathematical model that calculates the force produced by a muscle for the two schemes we found that the Onion-Skin scheme is more energy efficient, provides smoother muscle force at low to moderate force levels, and appears to be more conducive to evolutionary survival than the After-hyperpolarization scheme.},

@article{Heckman2009,
abstract = {The excitability of spinal motoneurons is both fundamental for motor behavior and essential in diagnosis of neural disorders. There are two mechanisms for altering this excitability. The classic mechanism is mediated by synaptic inputs that depolarize or hyperpolarize motoneurons by generating postsynaptic potentials. This "ionotropic" mechanism works via neurotransmitters that open ion channels in the cell membrane. In the second mechanism, neurotransmitters bind to receptors that activate intracellular signaling pathways. These pathways modulate the properties of the voltage-sensitive channels that determine the intrinsic input-output properties of motoneurons. This "neuromodulatory" mechanism usually does not directly activate motoneurons but instead dramatically alters the neuron's response to ionotropic inputs. We present extensive evidence that neuromodulatory inputs exert a much more powerful effect on motoneuron excitability than ionotropic inputs. The most potent neuromodulators are probably serotonin and norepinephrine, which are released by axons originating in the brainstem and can increase motoneuron excitability fivefold or more. Thus, the standard tests of motoneuron excitability (H-reflexes, tendon taps, tendon vibration and stretch reflexes) are strongly influenced by the level of neuromodulatory input to motoneurons. This insight is likely to be profoundly important for clinical diagnosis and treatment. ?? 2009 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.},

abstract = {Neurons from the mammalian CNS have a noninactivating component of the tetrodotoxin-sensitive sodium current (INaP). Although its magnitude is {\textless} 1{\%} of the transient sodium current, INaP has functional significance because it is activated about 10 mV negative to the transient sodium current, where few voltage-gated channels are activated and neuron input resistance is high. INaP adds to synaptic current, and evidence indicates that it is present in dendrites where relatively small depolarizations will activate INaP, thereby increasing effectiveness of distal depolarizing synaptic activity. The mechanism for INaP is not known. Research in striated muscle and neurons suggests a modal change in gating of conventional sodium channels, but it is also possible that INaP flows through a distinct subtype of noninactivating sodium channels. Modulation of INaP could have a significant effect on the transduction of synaptic currents by neurons.},

abstract = {The biophysical properties of cat motoneuron (MN) models with passive dendrite and different sizes have been extensively tested. However, the behavior of these models in relation to accommodation has not been tested yet. The experimental data reported have shown that MNs accommodate to a very limited degree, exhibiting, in some extension, breakdown of accommodation phenomenon. One possible explanation for the latter behavior would be the presence of persistent sodium conductance. The accommodation can be evaluated by observing threshold latency (TL) curve and the accommodation coefficient (I/I-o)(s), obtained from the response to linearly rising currents. The simulation results have showed that the models exhibit breakdown of accommodation phenomenon and much similar accommodation coefficients, despite their type: 1.463, 1.456 and 1.418 to S, FIR and FF MN models, respectively. According to these data, all the MN models can be classified as slowly accommodating. Our data suggests that accommodation coefficients cannot be associated to the size or to the type of the MN, and persistent sodium conductance might not be necessary to explain breakdown of accommodation phenomenon in MN soma at all.

abstract = {1. A variety of physiological properties of single motor units have been studied in the gastrocnemius muscle (primarily in the medial head) of pentobarbitone‐anaesthetized cats. Intracellular stimulation of individual motoneurones ensured functional isolation of the muscle units innervated by them. 2. A system for muscle unit classification was developed using a combination of two physiological properties. Almost all of the units studied could be classified into one of three major types, including two groups with relatively short twitch contraction times (types FF and FR, which were differentiable from one another on the basis of sensitivity to fatigue) and one group with relatively long contraction times (type S, which were extremely resistant to fatigue and were differentiable from FF and FR units on the basis of the shape of unfused tetani). Post‐tetanic potentiation of twitch responses was observed in all three muscle unit types. The distributions of axonal conduction velocities for motoneurones innervating FF and FR muscle units were essentially the same, while conduction velocities for motoneurones innervating type S units were, in general, slower. 3. Histochemical profiles of muscle units representative of each of the physiological classes present in the gastrocnemius pool were determined using a method of glycogen depletion for muscle unit identification. Each of the physiological categories of muscle units exhibited a corresponding unique set of muscle fibre staining reactions, or histochemical profile. Within each physiological type, all of the units examined had the same histochemical profile. The results generally support the hypothesis that the histochemical characteristics of muscle fibres are meaningfully related to the physiological properties of the same fibres. However, certain limitations in the detailed application of the hypothesis were also apparent. 4. Systematic assessment of the histochemical profiles of relatively large numbers of fibres belonging to single muscle units provided strong support for the hypothesis that all of the muscle fibres innervated by a single $\alpha$‐motoneurone are histochemically identical. {\textcopyright} 1973 The Physiological Society},

The statistical treatment of these spike trains is as stochastic point processes, the theory of which is briefly discussed. Evidence is presented that motor unit spike trains may be modelled by a renewal process with an underlying gaussian probability density. Statistical independence of successive interspike intervals is shown using scatter diagrams; the hypothesis of a gaussian distribution is accepted at the 99th percentile confidence limit, chi-square test, in 90{\%} of the units tested. A functional relationship between the mean and standard deviation is shown and discussed; its implications in obtaining sample size are presented in an appendix. The results of higher order analysis in the form of autocorrelograms and grouped interval histograms are presented. Grouped interval histograms are discussed in the context of motor unit data, and used to confirm the hypothesis that a stable probability density function does not represent a good model of the data at this level of analysis. ?? 1969, The Biophysical Society.

abstract = {1. Measurements of input resistance (RN), time constant (tau 0), and electrotonic length (Lpeel) were derived from intracellular voltage changes produced by injection of current pulses in six type-identified triceps surae alpha-motoneurons. The motoneurons were labeled with horseradish peroxidase and subsequently reconstructed and measured from serial sections. These quantitative morphological and physiological data were incorporated into detailed computer models of the motoneurons. 2. Steady-state and dynamic models were used to determine values for specific membrane resistivity (Rm) that matched the experimental estimates of RN, tau 0, and Lpeel for each motoneurons. The models were based on the following assumptions 1) the membrane was electrically passive, 2) cytoplasmic resistivity (Ri) was 70 omega-cm, and 3) "sealed-end" boundary conditions were present at dendritic terminations. We also considered the nature and magnitude of possible errors introduced by using linear (passive) computer models to match responses from motoneurons with nonlinear (i.e., voltage-dependent) conductances. 3. If we assume that the experimental measurements of RN and tau 0 were correct, uniform Rm values that reproduced the experimentally measured RN required widely varying values of Cm (1.4-8.6 microF/cm2) to match the experimental tau 0. Furthermore, the electrotonic distance to dendritic terminals was generally much greater than expected from physiological estimates of Lpeel. However, if we assumed that the RN measurements could have been underestimated by as much as 30{\%} and that Cm = 1.0 microF/cm2, it was possible to choose spatially uniform Rm that matched the observed tau 0 in three of six cases. 4. Relaxing the assumption of spatially uniform membrane resistivity permitted us to reconcile the anatomical and physiological characteristics of all six motoneurons. Two qualitatively different models of Rm nonuniformity gave equally good fits to the experimental results 1) a step-wise increase in Rm from a low value at the soma to a much higher but uniform value over the entire dendritic tree, and 2) a monotonic increase in Rm from soma to distal dendrites as a sigmoidal function of path distance along the dendrites. The step and sigmoidal models of the spatial distribution of Rm generated different electrotonic architectures in motoneuron dendritic trees, but both gave essentially identical electrical responses at the soma.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

abstract = {1. Excitatory post-synaptic potentials (e.p.s.p.s) were evoked in cat spinal motoneurones by impulses in single group Ia afferent fibres. The probability density of the fluctuations in peak amplitude of each e.p.s.p. was calculated from the recorded peak amplitude and the probability density of the recording noise. 2. Most e.p.s.p.s fluctuated between different components (i.e. individual e.p.s.p.s of a particular discrete amplitude) with peak amplitudes which were integer multiples of the increment between successive components. The average peak amplitude of this incremental e.p.s.p. was about 90 microV for e.p.s.p.s generated at or near the soma. 3. In general, the probability density of the peak amplitude could not be described using Poisson or binomial distributions. 4. For many e.p.s.p.s the complete time course of each component could be calculated. There was no variability in the amplitude of these components nor in their latency of onset. For some e.p.s.p.s there were differences in the latency and time course of the components. 5. The increments between successive components of e.p.s.p. generated proximally were no larger (at the soma) than the corresponding increments for e.p.s.p.s generated at more distal dendritic sites. 6. These results and those from subsequent papers (Jack, Redman {\&} Wong, 1981; Hirst, Redman {\&} Wong, 1981) reinforce earlier suggestions that each bouton behaves in an all-or-nothing manner with respect to post-synaptic effect, and the probability of failure varies at different boutons arising from the same afferent.},

abstract = {1. The relevance of motoneurone dynamic sensitivity in compensating for the low-pass filter properties of muscle was assessed by stimulating cat muscle units (MUs) with impulse discharges generated by two current-to-rate converters: (i) a spinal motoneurone, sensitive to both the input intensity and its first derivative, and (ii) a linear current-to-rate converter, i.e. a neurone model with the same static sensitivity as the motoneurone but lacking dynamic sensitivity. 2. Discharges generated by injection of sine-wave currents in three motoneurones of the 'fast' type and in the three related model versions were applied to the axon of forty-six MUs. The MU isometric tension was modulated at the frequency of the current sine wave (0.5-20 Hz). Phase and gain of the current-to-force transduction were measured. 3. When MUs were driven by the model, the force lagged the current by 90 deg at 1 Hz in slow MUs and at around 5 Hz in fast MUs. Under motoneurone drive, the 90 deg phase lag was attained at frequencies about twice as high. 4. The gain of the transduction (peak-to-peak force modulation/peak-to-peak current modulation) decayed when the modulation frequency was increased. In all but five units, the cut-off frequency, Fco (gain attenuated by -3 dB), was higher when the unit was motoneurone driven (FcoCell) then when it was model driven (FcoMod). In both conditions, Fco was inversely correlated with the MU's time-to-peak. The advantage conferred by the motoneurone dynamic sensitivity was expressed by the Fco ratio (FcoCell/FcoMod). Across the MU population this ratio ranged from 0. 6-2.8, was inversely correlated with the time-to peak, and was directly correlated with the half-tension rate, i.e. the impulse rate at which MUs develop 50 {\%} of their maximal tetanic force. The largest improvement (Fco ratio {\textgreater} 2.0) was found in units with mechanical features similar to those presumably coupled 'in vivo' to the motoneurones utilized for stimulation. 5. This estimate was confirmed in experiments in which trains of pulses, generated by injection of ramp currents in another motoneurone and the related model, were used to activate eight MUs, selected for being similar to that connected 'in vivo' to the motoneurone. As expected, for any given current slope the rising phase of isometric tension was steeper when units were motoneurone driven than when they were model driven. The gain (force slope/current slope) was plotted against the ramp slope to identify the cut-off slope, Sco, at which the gain was attenuated by -3 dB. In this homogeneous MU sample, the ratio expressing the advantage of the motoneurone drive (ScoCell/ScoMod, equivalent to the Fco ratio), ranged from 2.62-2.97, values comparable with those observed in sine-wave experiments when the motoneurone and muscle units were properly matched.},

abstract = {Single motor units of the flexor carpi radialis (FCR) muscle were activated with a series of constant-rate stimulus trains to study the relation between the frequency of activation and isometric tension development (F-T relation). The tension produced by each stimulus train was expressed as a percentage of the maximum tension-time area (Amax) found for a given unit. Between 25 and 75{\%} Amax a clear separation was seen in the rates needed to produce the same relative tension for the F-T curves of slow-twitch (type S) and fast-twitch (type F) units. Over the steepest portion of the F-T curve (25-50{\%} Amax), where tension output was most sensitive to changes in activation rate, type F units required substantially higher stimulation rates (30 pps) to achieve the same relative tension output as type S units. Furthermore, the frequency range that corresponded to the steep portion of the curve was 2.3 times greater for type F units. For both type S and F units, twitch duration was deemed to be an important determinant of the F-T curve, as has been shown previously. A direct continuous relation was seen between the integrated twitch time (ITT) and the stimulus interval needed to produce 50{\%} Amax (r = 0.94, P less than 0.001). Thus, units that had relatively brief twitches required higher activation rates to achieve the same relative percentage of Amax. Comparison of F-T curves from FCR with those derived by other investigators for cat hindlimb units (medial gastrocnemius and peroneus longus) revealed that significant differences in activation rates were needed to produce the same percentage of Amax throughout the midrange of the F-T curve. At 50{\%} Amax, type F units in FCR required activation rates approximately 20 pps higher than type F units in the hindlimb. Type S units in FCR required only slightly higher rates (approximately equal to 5 pps). Based on a number of well-founded assumptions, F-T curves derived from FCR units were used to estimate the potential contribution of rate coding to total muscle tension by type S and F units. This analysis leads to the conclusion that rate modulation is a potentially important factor in the gradation of tension for the FCR muscle.},

abstract = {We analyzed the transformation of synaptic input to the pool of motor neurons into the neural drive to the muscle. The aim was to explain the relations between common oscillatory signals sent to motor neurons and the effective component of the neural signal sent to muscles as output of the spinal cord circuitries. The approach is based on theoretical derivations, computer simulations, and experiments. It is shown theoretically that for frequencies smaller than the average discharge rates of the motor neurons, the pool of motor neurons determines a pure amplification of the frequency components common to all motor neurons, so that the common input is transmitted almost undistorted and the non-common components are strongly attenuated. The effective neural drive to the muscle thus mirrors the common synaptic input to motor neurons. The simulations with three models of motor neuron confirmed the theoretical results by showing that the coherence function between common input components and the neural drive to the muscle tends to one when increasing the number of active motor neurons. This result, which was relatively insensitive to the type of model used, was also supported experimentally by observing that, in the low-pass signal bandwidth, the peak in coherence between groups of motor units of the abductor digiti minimi muscle of 5 healthy subjects tended to one when increasing the number of motor units. These results have implications for our understanding of the neural control of muscles as well as for methods used for estimating the strength of common input to populations of motor neurons.

@article{Hu2014,
abstract = {Objective . Muscle force is generated by a combination of motor unit (MU) recruitment and changes in the discharge rate of active MUs. There have been two basic MU recruitment and firing rate paradigms reported in the literature, which describe the control of the MUs during force generation. The first (termed the reverse ‘onion skin' profile), exhibits lower firing rates for lower threshold units, with higher firing rates occurring in higher threshold units. The second (termed the ‘onion skin' profile), exhibits an inverse arrangement, with lower threshold units reaching higher firing rates. Approach . Using a simulation of the MU activity in a hand muscle, this study examined the force generation capacity and the variability of the muscle force magnitude at different excitation levels of the MU pool under these two different MU control paradigms. We sought to determine which rate/recruitment scheme was more efficient for force generation, and which scheme gave rise to the lowest force variability. Main results . We found that the force output of both firing patterns leads to graded force output at low excitation levels, and that the force generation capacity of the two different paradigms diverged around 50{\%} excitation. In the reverse ‘onion skin' pattern, at 100{\%} excitation, the force output reached up to 88{\%} of maximum force, whereas for the ‘onion skin' pattern, the force output only reached up to 54{\%} of maximum force at 100{\%} excitation. The force variability was lower at the low to moderate force levels under the ‘onion skin' paradigm than with the reverse ‘onion skin' firing patterns, but this effect was reversed at high force levels. Significance . This study captures the influence of MU recruitment and firing rate organization on muscle force properties, and our results suggest that the different firing organizations can be beneficial at different levels of voluntary muscle force generation and perhaps for different tasks.},

@article{Jones2002,
abstract = {It has been proposed that the invariant kinematics observed during goal-directed movements result from reducing the consequences of signal-dependent noise (SDN) on motor output. The purpose of this study was to investigate the presence of SDN during isometric force production and determine how central and peripheral components contribute to this feature of motor control. Peripheral and central components were distinguished experimentally by comparing voluntary contractions to those elicited by electrical stimulation of the extensor pollicis longus muscle. To determine other factors of motor-unit physiology that may contribute to SDN, a model was constructed and its output compared with the empirical data. SDN was evident in voluntary isometric contractions as a linear scaling of force variability (SD) with respect to the mean force level. However, during electrically stimulated contractions to the same force levels, the variability remained constant over the same range of mean forces. When the subjects were asked to combine voluntary with stimulation-induced contractions, the linear scaling relationship between the SD and mean force returned. The modeling results highlight that much of the basic physiological organization of the motor-unit pool, such as range of twitch amplitudes and range of recruitment thresholds, biases force output to exhibit linearly scaled SDN. This is in contrast to the square root scaling of variability with mean force present in any individual motor-unit of the pool. Orderly recruitment by twitch amplitude was a necessary condition for producing linearly scaled SDN. Surprisingly, the scaling of SDN was independent of the variability of motoneuron firing and therefore by inference, independent of presynaptic noise in the motor command. We conclude that the linear scaling of SDN during voluntary isometric contractions is a natural by-product of the organization of the motor-unit pool that does not depend on signal-dependent noise in the motor command. Synaptic noise in the motor command and common drive, which give rise to the variability and synchronization of motoneuron spiking, determine the magnitude of the force variability at a given level of mean force output.},

abstract = {New Findings What is the central question of this study? The influences of motor unit recruitment threshold and twitch force potentiation on the changes in firing rates during steady‐force muscular contractions are not well understood. What is the main finding and its importance? The behaviour of motor units during steady force was influenced by recruitment threshold, such that firing rates decreased for lower‐threshold motor units but increased for higher‐threshold motor units. In addition, individuals with greater changes in firing rates possessed greater twitch force potentiation. There are contradictory reports regarding changes in motor unit firing rates during steady‐force contractions. Inconsistencies are likely to be the result of previous studies disregarding motor unit recruitment thresholds and not examining firing rates on a subject‐by‐subject basis. It is hypothesized that firing rates are manipulated by twitch force potentiation during contractions. Therefore, in this study we examined time‐related changes in firing rates at steady force in relationship to motor unit recruitment threshold in the first dorsal interosseous and the influence of twitch force potentiation on such changes in young versus aged individuals. Subjects performed a 12 s steady‐force contraction at 50{\%} maximal voluntary contraction, with evoked twitches before and after the contraction to quantify potentiation. Firing rates, in relationship to recruitment thresholds, were determined at the beginning, middle and end of the steady force. There were no firing rate changes for aged individuals. For the young, firing rates decreased slightly for lower‐threshold motor units but increased for higher‐threshold motor units. Twitch force potentiation was greater for young than aged subjects, and changes in firing rates were correlated with twitch force potentiation. Thus, individuals with greater increases in firing rates of higher‐threshold motor units and decreases in lower‐threshold motor units possessed greater twitch force potentiation. Overall, changes in firing rates during brief steady‐force contractions are dependent on recruitment threshold and explained in part by twitch force potentiation. Given that firing rate changes were measured in relationship to recruitment threshold, this study illustrates a more complete view of firing rate changes during steady‐force contractions.},

abstract = {The Hoffmann (or H) reflex is considered a major probe for non-invasive study of sensorimotor integration and plasticity of the central nervous system in humans. The first section of this paper reviews the neurophysiological properties of the H-reflex, which if ignored create serious pitfalls in human experimental studies. The second section reviews the spinal inhibitory circuits and neuronal pathways that can be indirectly assessed in humans using the H-reflex. The most confounding factor is that reciprocal, presynaptic, and Ib inhibition do not act in isolation during movement. Therefore, characterization of these spinal circuits should be more comprehensive, especially in cases of a neurological injury because neurophysiological findings are critical for the development of successful rehabilitation protocols. To conclude, the H-reflex is a highly sensitive reflex with an amplitude that is the result of complex neural mechanisms that act synchronously. If these limitations are recognized and addressed, the H-reflex constitutes one of the major probes to assess excitability of interneuronal circuits at rest and during movement in humans. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.
